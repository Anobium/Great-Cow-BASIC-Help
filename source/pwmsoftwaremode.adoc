==== PWM Software Mode

*Syntax:*
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
    PWMOut _channel, duty cycle, cycles_
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.  This method does NOT require a PWM module within the microcontroller.

This command uses a software PWM routine within Great Cow BASIC to produce
a PWM signal on the selected port of the chip.

The method `PWMOut` does not make use of any special hardware within the microcontroller.
The PWM signal is generated only while the `PWMOut` command is executing - therefore, when the `PWMOut` is not executing
by moving onto the next command, the PWM signal will stop.
