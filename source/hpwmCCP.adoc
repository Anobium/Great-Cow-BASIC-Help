==== HPWM CCP

*Syntax:*
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
    HPWM _channel, frequency, duty cycle_
----
*Command Availability:*

Only available on Microchip PIC microcontrollers with Capture/Compare/PWM (CCP)
module.

This command supports the CCP 8 bit support with *Timer 2 only*. +

For PWM 10 Bit support with other timers - see here <<_hpwm_10_bit,HPWM 10 Bit>>

*Explanation:*

This command sets up the hardware PWM module of the Microchip PIC microcontroller to generate
a PWM waveform of the given frequency and duty cycle. +

If you only need one particular frequency and duty cycle, you should use PWMOn and
the constants PWM_Freq and PWM_Duty instead.

`_channel_` is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, and corresponds to the pins CCP1, CCP2, CCP3, CCP4 and CCP5
respectively. On chips with only one CCP port, pin CCP or CCP1 is always
used, and `_channel_` is ignored. (It should be set to 1 anyway to allow
for future upgrades to more powerful microcontrollers.)

`_frequency_` sets the frequency of the PWM output. It is measured in KHz.
The maximum value allowed is 255 KHz. The minimum value varies depending
on the clock speed. 1 KHz is the minimum on chips 16 MHz or under and 2
Khz is the lowest possible on 20 MHz chips. In situations that do not
require a specific PWM frequency, the PWM frequency should equal
approximately 1 five-hundredth the clock speed of the microcontroller (ie 40 Khz on
a 20 MHz chip, 16 KHz on an 8 MHz chip). This gives the best duty cycle
resolution possible.

`_duty cycle_` specifies the desired duty cycle of the PWM signal, and
ranges from 0 to 255 where 255 is 100% duty cycle.

To stop the PWM signal use the `HPWMOff` method with the parameter of the channel.

----
    'Stop the CCP/PWM signal
    HPWMOff ( 1 )

The optional constant `HPWM_FAST` can be defined to enable the recalculation of the
timer prescaler when needed.  This will provide faster operation, but uses extra byte
of RAM and may cause problems if `HPWM` and `PWMOn` are used together in a program.
This will not cause any issue when using `HPWM` and `PWMOff` in the same program with `HPWM_FAST`.

The optional constant `DisableCCPFixedModePWM` can be defined to prevent Timer2 from being enabled.  This constant may be required when you need to use Timer2 for non-CCP/PWM support.

*Example:*
----
    'This program will alter the brightness of an LED using
    'CCP/PWM.

    'Select chip model and speed
    #chip 16F877A, 20

    'Set the CCP1 pin to output mode
    DIR PORTC.2 out

    'Main code
    do
        'Turn up brightness over the range
        For Bright = 1 to 255
            HPWM 1, 40, Bright
            wait 10 ms
        next
        'Turn down brightness over the range
        For Bright = 255 to 1
            HPWM 1, 40, Bright
            wait 10 ms
        next
    loop
