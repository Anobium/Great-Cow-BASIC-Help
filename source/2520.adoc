I2CReceive

'''''

*Syntax:*
HI2CReceive _data_
 +
HI2CReceive _data_, _ACK_
HI2CReceive _data_, N_ACK_
 +
 +
*Command Availability:*
Only available in GCB HI2C.h with release after 6/2014
 +
Available on all microcontrollers with the MSSP module.
 +
*Explanation:*
The HI2CReceive command will send _data_ through the I2C connection. If
_ack_ is TRUE, or no value is given for _ack_, then I2CReceive will send
an ack to the I2C bus.
 +
If in master mode, I2CReceive will read the data immediately. If in
slave mode, I2CReceive will wait for the master to send the data before
reading.
 +
*Example:*
'This program reads an I2C register and sets an LED if it is over 100.
 +
'It will read from I2C device with an address of 83, register 1.
