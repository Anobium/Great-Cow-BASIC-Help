==== Parabola:

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    Parabola (x,  y,  p_factor,  type, modestop, optional LineColour=GLCDForeground)
----
*Explanation:*

Draws on a GLCD a parabola with equation y^2=2*p_factor*x, centered at  pixel positions (x, y) .

The parabola is an unbounded curve.

The parabola can be alined either along the x axis or along the y axis.


Drawing parabola on the screen can be constrained by following two different criteria:
	- a branch has reached a border of the display.
	- both branches have reached the display border.

For a parabola centered on the display these criteria are equivalent.

|*Parameter*
|*Controls*

|`x, y`
|X, Y coordinates of the parabola vertex.  X is the minimum x value of the parabola when alined along X.
					   Y is the minimum y value of the parabola when alined along y {nbsp}{nbsp}in pixel positions



The x or y coordinates are Word value, p_factor is word value, type and ModeStop are byte values .

|`p_factor`
|The factor such that y^2=2*p_factor*x is the equation of the parabola

|`type`
|type=1 the parabola is aligned along x axis
{empty} +
type=2 the parabola is aligned along y axis

|`modestop`
|modestop=1 drawing stops when a display border is encountered by a parabola branch.
{empty} +
modestop=2 drawing stops when all the parabolla branches encountered a border

|`LineColour`
|Color of the parabola
