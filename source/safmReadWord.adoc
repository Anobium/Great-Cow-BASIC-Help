==== SAFReadWord


*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    'as a subroutine
    SAFReadWord ( location, data_word_variable )

    'as a function
    data_word_variable = SAFReadWord ( location )
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all PIC micro-controllers with SAFM memory

*Explanation:*
{empty} +
{empty} +
SAFReadWord is used to read information, word values, from SAFM so that it can be accessed for use in a user program.
{empty} +
{empty} +
`location` represents the location or relative address to read. The location will range from 0 to SAF_BYTES -1.&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Each data Word requires 2 SAF Locations, therefore the location will range from either 0 to 254 or 0 to 126 (in steps of 2),  depending upon the device. 
{empty} +
{empty} +
`data` is the data that is to be read from the SAFM data storage.&#160;&#160;&#160;
A word value.&#160;&#160;&#160;
This must be a variable.
{empty} +
{empty} +
This method reads information to the SAFM given its relative location in the SAFM data storage.&#160;&#160;&#160;
{empty} +

*Example 1:*
----
    '... code preamble to select part
    '... code to setup serial

    'The following example uses a subroutine to read an SAFM location into a word variable.

    dim data_word_variable as word
    
    ;Write a word to SAF location 64
    SAFWriteWord(  64, 0x4321 )
    
    ; Read the Word from SAF location 64
    SAFReadWord ( 64, data_word_variable  )
    
    HSerPrint "Value = "
    HSerPrint data_word_variable
    HSerPrintCRLF
----
{empty} +
If example 1 were displayed on a serial terminal.&#160;&#160;&#160;The result would show:

----
    Value = 4660
----
{empty} +
{empty} +
*Example 2:*
----
    '... code preamble to select part
    '... code to setup serial

    'The following example uses a function to read an SAFM location into a word variable.

    dim data_word_variable as word
    
    ;Write a word to SAF location 64
    SAFWriteWord(  64, 0x4321 )
    
    ; Read the Word from SAF location 64
    data_word_variable = SAFReadWord ( 64 )

    HSerPrint "Value = "
    HSerPrint data_word_variable
    HSerPrintCRLF

----
{empty} +
If example 2 were displayed on a serial terminal.&#160;&#160;&#160;The result would show:

----
    Value = 17185
