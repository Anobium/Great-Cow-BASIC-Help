==== EPWrite

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]

----
    EPWrite _location_, _data_
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all Microchip PIC and Atmel AVR microcontrollers with EEPROM data memory.

*Explanation:*

`EPWrite` is used to write information to the EEPROM data storage, so that
it can be accessed later by a programmer on the PC, or by the `EPRead`
command. `_location_` represents the location to read data from, and varies
from one chip to another. `_data_` is the data that is to be written to the
EEPROM, and can be a value or a variable.

*Example:*

----
    #chip 16F819, 8

    'Set the input pin direction
    Dir PORTA.0 In

    'Loop to take readings until the EEPROM is full
    For CurrentAddress = 0 to 255

    'Take a reading and log it
    EPWrite CurrentAddress, ReadAD(AN0)

    'Wait 10 minutes before getting another reading
    Wait 10 min
