
Looking into the USART issue with respect to the setting for the baud rate for specific microcontrollers.

*The Microchip published algorithm is as follows:*

- For a device with Fosc of 16 MHz, desired baud rate of 9600, Asynchronous mode, and 8-bit BRG:
- Desired Baud Rate = FOSC/(64 ([SPBRGHx:SPBRGx] + 1))
- Solving for SPBRGHx:SPBRGx:

    `
    X = ((FOSC/Desired Baud Rate)/64) – 1
    = ((16000000/9600)/64) – 1
    = [25.042] = 25
`
Where the calculated Baud Rate is resolved as, using the determined value (of `25` from the previous calculation).
`
    = 16000000/(64 (25 + 1))
    = 9615 ' resulting baud rate with an error rate of of 0.16%
    '

*Great Cow BASIC algorithm is a follows*

- For a device with Fosc of 16 MHz, desired baud rate of 9600, Asynchronous mode, and 8-bit BRG:
- Desired Baud Rate = = FOSC/(64 ([SPBRGHx:SPBRGx] + 1))
- Solving for SPBRGHx:SPBRGx:

    `
    X =  ChipMHz / USART_BAUD_RATE / 64 * 1000000 - 1
    = 16 / 9600 / 64 * 100000 - 1
    = (16 / 9600 / 64 * 100000) - 1  'just adding braces to show maths priority'
    = [25.042] = 25
`


*Examination of the difference approaches*

    `
    The two calcs
    ((16000000/9600)/64) – 1 = (16 / 9600 / 64 * 100000) - 1

    Removal of the -1 from both sides
    ((16000000/9600)/64) = (16 / 9600 / 64 * 100000)

    Simple move of 10000000 to ChipMHz
    ((16000000/9600)/64) = (16000000 / 9600 / 64 )
    `

So, these calculations are the same
