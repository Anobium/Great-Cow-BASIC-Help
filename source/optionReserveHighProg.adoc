=== #Option ReserveHighProg

*Syntax:*
----
    #option ReserveHighProg [words]
----
This option reserves program memory to be kept free at the top end of memory.&#160;&#160;This useful for HEF/SAF or bootloaders

The option provided a reservation for the memory region that is normally assumed to be available to
the compiler for the application code storage. In order to avoid any possible conflict (overlapping code
and data usage), it is important to reserve the devicespecific memory range by using the compiler option (shown above)
in the project configuration.

In the example below the region 0x1F80 to 0x1FFF (flash block for a
PIC16F1509 microcontroller) has been removed from the default space available for code storage using the compiler option.

*Example:*

    'Set chip model
    #chip 16F1509

    'Example command
    #option ReserveHighProg 128
