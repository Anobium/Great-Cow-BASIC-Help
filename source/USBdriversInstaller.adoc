=== USB Drivers Installer

WARNING: Installing the USB driver is only required when using the Great Cow BASIC USB library.

*Description:*

The drivers for windows x86 and x64 correspond to the USB LIBKWIN capability of Great-Cow Basic for supported PIC microcontrollers.

For security reasons, in Microsoft windows for a driver to be installed, it is necessary that it be digitally signed by Microsoft.

Microsoft did make a special “Test” mode for developers to install MANUALLY unsigned drivers for debug and testing, being a technical advanced and not user-friendly procedure; at the same time the windows developers make efforts to disable the capability of doing this in an automated fashion by the concerns of being used as a vulnerability of the operating system.

This scenario will make installing test drivers difficult and frustrating for the uninitiated, at the same time for a useful Hobby project it will be not practical to make end users to take all this drama.

This driver installer method resolves the constraints imposed by the Windows operating system, and, therefore will allow you to install the drivers in the easiest way possible, almost like any driver of a well-known company.

*Usage:*

WARNING: The installer will reboot the system without notice. Please close all programs and save any work you have open before begin whit the driver install.

1 - Open the installer, it will request admin rights.

2 - Navigate thru the wizard to automatically extract the driver files (there aren’t any options to select).

3 - At the end of the wizard, after you click the exit button, the system will restart automatically

WARNING: In the case where your computer has Secure Boot enabled, the installer will advise you of extra steps needed after reboot, at the end of this page you will find a graphic reflecting those steeps and what elements you need to select.

4 - After restart and login in to your user account, a window will inform you that the driver is not signed and you will be asked if you want to install the driver, please allow it.

5 - when the driver has been installed, the computer will restart automatically.
