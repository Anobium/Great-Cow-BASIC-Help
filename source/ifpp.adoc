=== #if

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    #if __Condition__
      ...
    #endif
----
*Explanation:*

The `#if` directive is used to prevent a section of code from compiling unless `_Condition_` is true.

`_Condition_` has the same syntax as the condition in a normal Great Cow BASIC if command. The only difference is that it uses constants instead of variables.

*Example:*
----
    'This program will pulse an adjustable number of pins on PORTB
    'The number of pins is controlled by the FlashPins constant
    #chip 16F88, 8

    'The number of pins to flash
    #define FlashPins 2

    'Initialise
    Dir PORTB Out

    'Main loop
    Do
        #if FlashPins >= 1
            PulseOut PORTB.0, 250 ms
        #endif
        #if FlashPins >= 2
            PulseOut PORTB.1, 250 ms
        #endif
        #if FlashPins >= 3
            PulseOut PORTB.2, 250 ms
        #endif
        #if FlashPins >= 4
            PulseOut PORTB.3, 250 ms
        #endif
    Loop
