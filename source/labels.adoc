=== Labels

*About Labels*

Labels are used as markers throughout the program. Labels are used to
mark a position in the program to ‘jump to’ from another position using
a goto, gosub or other command.

Labels can be any word (that is not already a reserved keyword) and may
contain digits and the underscore character. Labels must start with a
letter or underscore (not digit), and are followed directly by a colon
(:) at the marker position. The colon is not required within the actual
commands.

The compiler is not case sensitive. Lower and/or upper case may be used
at any time.

*Example:*
----
    'This program will flash the light until the button is pressed
    'off. Notice the label named SWITCH_OFF.

    #chip 16F628A, 4

    #define BUTTON PORTB.0
    #define LIGHT PORTB.1
    Dir BUTTON In
    Dir BUTTON Out

    Do
    PulseOut LIGHT, 500 ms
    If BUTTON = 1 Then Goto SWITCH_OFF
    Wait 500 ms
    If BUTTON = 1 Then Goto SWITCH_OFF
    Loop

    SWITCH_OFF:
    Set LIGHT Off
    'Chip will enter low power mode when program ends
