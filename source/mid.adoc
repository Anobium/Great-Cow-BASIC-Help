    __output__ = Mid(__source__, __start__, __count__)
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers

*Explanation:*

The `Mid` function is used to extract characters from the middle of a string variable. `_source_` is the variable to extract from, `_start_` is the position of the first character to extract, and `_count_` is the number of characters to extract. If `_count_` is not specified, all characters from `_start_` to the end of the source string will be returned.

*Example:*
----
    'Set chip model
    #chip 16F1936

    'Set up hardware serial connection
    #define USART_BAUD_RATE 9600
    #define USART_TX_BLOCKING


    'Fill a string with a message
    Dim TestData As String
    TestData = "The cat sat on the mat"

    'Extract "cat". The c is at position 5, and 3 letters are needed
    HSerPrint "The animal is a "
    HSerPrint Mid(TestData, 5, 3)

    'Extract the action. "sat" starts at position 9.
    HSerPrint "The animal "
    HSerPrint Mid(TestData, 9)
    HSerPrintCRLF
