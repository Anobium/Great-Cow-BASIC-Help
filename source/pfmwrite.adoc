[subs="quotes"]

----
    PFMWrite (_location_, _value_)
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all Microchip PIC microcontrollers with PFM self write capability.

*Explanation:*

`PFMWrite` writes information to the program memory on chips that
support this feature. `_location_` is a word variable, and `_store_` can be a byte of word.

The largest value possible for `_location_` depends on the amount of
program memory on the microcontroller.

This is an advanced command which should only be used by advanced
developers.
