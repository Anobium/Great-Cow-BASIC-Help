== Libraries Overview

*About Libraries*
[subs="quotes"]
Great Cow BASIC (as with most other microcontroller programming languages) supports libraries.



You can create you own device specific library, you are not limited to those shown below.  If you create a new device specific library - please submit for inclusion in the next release via the Great Cow BASIC forum.


Maintenance of these libraries is completed by the Great Cow BASIC development team.  If you wish to adapt these libraries you should create a local copy, edit and save within your development file structure.  The development team may update these libraries as part of a release and we do not want you to lose your local changes.

To use a library, simple inlcude the following in your user code

----
    #include <3PI.H>    'this will include the 3PI capabilities within your program
----

To use a local copy of a library, simple inlcude the following in your user code

----
    #include "C:\mydev\library\3pi.h"    'this will include a local copy of the the 3PI capabilities within your program
----


Great Cow BASIC supports the following device libraries.
