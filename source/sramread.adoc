==== SRAMRead

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    SRAMRead _location, store_

    or

    _store = SRAMRead location_
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all Microchip PIC and Atmel AVR microcontrollers with SRAM data memory attached.

*Explanation:*

`SRAMRead` is the method, a function or a subroutine, used to read information from the SRAM data storage.

`_location_` represents the location to read data from.

`_store_` is the variable in which to store the data after it has been read from SRAM.

*Example:*

----
    #include <uno_mega328p.h>
    #option explicit

    'Set up SRAM
    #define SPISRAM_CS      DIGITAL_5     'Also known as SS, or Slave Select
    #define SPISRAM_SCK     DIGITAL_13    'Also known as CLK
    #define SPISRAM_DO      DIGITAL_11    'Also known as MOSI
    #define SPISRAM_DI      DIGITAL_12    'Also known as MISO

    #define SPISRAM_HARDWARESPI
    #define SPISRAM_TYPE     SRAM_23LC1024

  '********************************************************************************

  'Main program

  dim in_byte as byte

  'Using a function:  Read from SRAM location 0x10 and place the results in the variable in_byte
  in_byte = SRAMRead ( 0x10 )

  'Using a subroutine:  Read from SRAM location 0x10 and place the results in the variable in_byte
  SRAMRead ( 0x10, in_byte )
