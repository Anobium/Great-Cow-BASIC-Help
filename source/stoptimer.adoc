This example will measure that time that a switch is depressed (or on) and will write the results to the EEPROM.  +
The example shows how to stop a timer when not in use.

    Dir Switch In
    DataCount = 0

    'Initilise Timer 1
    InitTimer1 Osc, PS1_8

    Dim TimerValue As Word

    Do
        ClearTimer 1
        Wait Until Switch = On
        StartTimer 1
        Wait Until Switch = Off
        StopTimer 1

        'Read the timer
        TimerValue = Timer1

        'Log the timer value
        EPWrite(DataCount, TimerValue_H)
        EPWrite(DataCount + 1, TimerValue)
        DataCount += 2
