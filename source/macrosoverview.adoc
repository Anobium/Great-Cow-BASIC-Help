=== Macros Overview

*Introduction:*

You can use macros within your Great Cow BASIC code.

Macros are similar to subroutines. But during compilation, everything is inserted inline. This may increase the code size slightly, but it also reduces stack usage.

Parameters are handled in a similar way to how constants are handled, so there is a lot more freedom when passing things in to a macro. (Unlike subs or functions, where everything must be stored in a variable.)

For example, for `PulseOut` one parameter is a pin, and the other is a time length like "500 ms". Neither of those parameters could be stored in a variable, but passing them in as macro parameters is possible.

*Demonstration Program:*
----
    'PulseOut Macro
    macro Pulseout (Pin, Time)
        Set Pin On
        Wait Time
        Set Pin Off
    end macro
