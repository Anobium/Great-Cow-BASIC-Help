*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    output = PS2ReadByte
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

`PS2ReadByte` will read a byte from the PS/2 bus. It will return the byte,
or 0 if no data was returned by the PS/2 device.

The PS/2 bus will normally be held in the inhibit state. `PS2ReadByte`
will uninhibit the bus for 25 ms. If a response is received, it will be
read. Then, the bus will be placed back in the inhibit state.

*Example:*

For an example, please refer to the `InKey` function.
<<_inkey,PS2 Inkey>>
