==== Concatenation

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    __stringvar__ = variable1 + variable2
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers

*Explanation:*

The method joins two variables into another variable.

This method does not change the existing strings, but returns a *new* string containing the text of the joined variables, see Concatenated String Constraint below.

Concatenation joins the elements of a specified values using the specified separator between each variable.


WARNING: Using concatenation when the compiler where the compiler creates a system string variable is bad practice.&#160;&#160;There is a risk that the compiler does not allocate sufficient RAM to hold the concatenated string.&#160;&#160;
The resulting string may be corrupted is the size of the system string variable is not set within the source program.

*Set a specific size of compiler created system string variable*

Use the following to set the size of compiler created system string variable.&#160;&#160;

The compiler will create system string variables when you concatenate on a commands line like `HSerPrint`, `Print` and many others commands.&#160;&#160;
Using concatenate with a command is bad practice, using a lot of RAM and may create a number of system string variables.&#160;&#160;
It is recommended to define a string (of a known length), concatenate using an assignment then use the string.&#160;&#160;

This constraint does not apply using concatenation as an assignment.&#160;&#160;

To control the size of system string variable use the following.&#160;&#160;
Also, use this constant to set the size when the compiler does not create a system string variable.&#160;&#160;

----

    'Define the constant to control the size of system created string variables called SYSSTRINGPARAM1, SYSSTRINGPARAM2 etc.
    Use #DEFINE  SYSDEFAULTCONCATSTRING  4

    'Then, use
    HSerPrint "A"+"123"   'will print A123. Without the SYSDEFAULTCONCATSTRING constant some microcontrollers may corrupt the result of the concatentation.

*Example 1:*
[subs="quotes"]
----

    timevariable = 999
    __stringvar__ = "Time = " + str(timevariable) ' Convert the __timevariable__ to a String.  This operation returns *Time = 999*

*Example 2:*
[subs="quotes"]
An example showing how to set a string to an escape sequence for an ANSI terminal.&#160;&#160;You can `Dim`ension a string and then assign the elements like an array.

{empty} +
{empty} +

----
    dim line2 as string
    line2 =  27, "[", "2", "H", 27, "[","K"
    HSerPrint line2
----
Will send the following to the terminal.
<esc>[2H<esc>[K

{empty} +
{empty} +

*Note: Concatenated String Constraint @v0.98.00 and prior versions*

When concatenating a string you cannot assign a string to itself.&#160;&#160;You must assign the result of string concatenation to another string. See below.

*Example to resolve string handling constraint:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    dim outstring1, tmpstring as string * 16
    dim outnumber as byte

    outnumber = 24
    outstring1 = "Result = "
    'This concatenation will yield an incorrect string
    outstring1 = outstring1 +str(outnumber)

    'This concatenation will yield an the correct string. With tmpstring1 containing the correct concatenated string
    tmpstring1 = outstring1 +str(outnumber)


----
{empty} +
To resolve the constraint simply assign the source string to another string.

{empty} +
