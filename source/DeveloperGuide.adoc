This section addresses developing libraries but this guide is appropriate to any Great Cow BASIC development.

The section covers the recommended programming style, Constants, Variables, Script syntax (gotchas) and tab usage.

'''

*PROGRAMMING STYLES*

Indenting is standardized.

All scripts within a specific library should be the first major section the library.   Scripts within methods should not be used.

Some #defines may need to be placed before the script to provide clarity to the structure of the library.

----
        #startup  startupsub

        #Define I2C_ADDRESS_1  0x4E    'The default address if user does not specify in the user program

        #SCRIPT
                ... code script
                ... code script
                ... code script
       #ENDSCRIPT
----

Scripts support structures like IF <CONDITION> THEN <ACTION> END iF.
Scripts supports the <condition> argument that must generate a TRUE result, meaning that at a literal level, your conditional formatting rule is an If - THEN statement along the lines of â€œIf this condition is TRUE, THEN process the <ACTION>.  the condition must use   logical "AND" and "OR" to test two conditions.
Using "AND" or "OR" reduces the script size, however, it is essential the the conditional test(s) are valid.  If a test fails then  you may not get the results you expect.

----
        IF .. THEN

        END IF

*CONSTANTS*

A constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution.&#160;&#160;
Within Great Cow BASIC there are two ways to create constants.&#160; &#160;
1. with the `#DEFINE` instruction, or,
2. via `#SCRIPT .. #ENDSCRIPT'. ;&#160;&#160; Within a script constants can be created and changed.  A script is process that is executed  prior to the Great Cow BASIC source program is processing the main user program.

An example of using `#DEFINE` is

----
        #DEFINE TIME_DELAY_VALUE    10
----

The script construct is

----
        #SCRIPT
              'Create a constant
              TIME_REPEAT_VALUE  =  10
        #ENDSCRIPT
----

*_Guide for constants_*

The following rules are recommended.

1 - All CONSTANTS are capitalized

2 - Do not define a constant in a library unless required

3 - Create all library constants within a script ( see example below *Constrain a Constant Example* on how to constrain a constant)

2 - Underscores are permitted in constant names within Scripts **

3 - No prefix is required when a CONSTANT is PUBLIC.  A PUBLIC constant is one that the user sets or the user can use.

4 - Prefix CONSTANTS with SCRIPT_  when the CONSTANT is used outside of the library specific script section AND ARE NOT EXPOSED AS PUBLIC Constants.

5 - Prefix CONSTANTS with __ (two underscores)  when the CONSTANT is ONLY used inside the library specific script section

6 - For PUBLIC prefix CONSTANTS with the capability name, _ (one underscore)  and then a meaningful title, as follows
            GLCD_HEIGHT
            SPISRAM_TYPE

7 - All scripts within a specific library should be the first major section the library.   Scripts within methods  ( Sub, Functions) should not be used.

8 - All scripts within a specific library should be the first major section the library.   Scripts within methods  ( Sub, Functions) should not be used.

9 - Other naming recommendations.   Do not use underscores in subroutine, function or variable names





*_Example script within a library_*

----
          #startup  startupsub
          #DEFINE I2C_ADDRESS_1  0x4E    'Default address if user omits
          #SCRIPT
                'script code
                'script code
                'script code
          #ENDSCRIPT
----


*_Simple Example_*

----
     #SCRIPT  'Calculate Delay Time
             __LCD_DELAY  = ( __LCD_TIMEPERIOD - __LCD_DELAYS) - (INT((4/ChipMHZ) * __LCD_INSTRUCTIONS))
            SCRIPT_LCD_POSTWRITEDELAY = __LCD_DELAY
            SCRIPT_LCD_CHECKBUSYFLAG = TRUE
     #ENDSCRIPT

     'usage within user code or code outside of script
     #IF SCRIPT_LCD_CHECKBUSYFLAG = TRUE
           WaitForReady    'Call subroutine to poll busy flag
           set LCD_RW OFF  'Write mode
     #ENDIF
     WAIT SCRIPT_LCDPOSTWRITEDELAY us
----

*_Create Constant Example_*

Background:&#160;&#160;All constants are always processed, regardless of where they are placed in the user code or library.&#160;&#160;
This includes any constant defined anywhere in user code or any library - the constant will be processed and the constant will be defined.&#160;&#160;
The only method to constrain a constant is via a script.&#160;&#160;

The following code segment will not constrain the constant.&#160;&#160;
The constant `MYCONSTANT` will be created.&#160;&#160;The `#IFDEF PIC` will not constrain even if an AVR or LGT chip.

----
    #IFDEF PIC
          #DEFINE MYCONSTANT 255
    #ENDIF
----

The recommended method follows.  The constant will only be created when a PIC.

----
    #SCRIPT
      IF PIC then
          MYCONSTANT  = 255
       End IF
    #ENDSCRIPT
----

*_Constrain a Constant Example_*

An example to constrain a constant is to test if a user constant is define in the user source program.&#160;&#160;
In this example the constant `SENDALOW` is defined in user source program.&#160;&#160;

- If yes, then define the library specific constants.&#160;&#160;
- If no, then do not define the library specific constants.&#160;&#160;

Using the method below defines constants only when the user requires the constants assuming they have defined `SENDALOW` in the user source program.

----
    #SCRIPT
         IF SENDALOW then
                NONE = 0 : ODD = 1 : EVEN = 2 : NORMAL = 0 : INVERT = 1
                WAITFORSTART = 128 : SERIALINITDELAY = 5
         END IF

         IF SENDALOW then
                NONE = 0 : ODD = 1 : EVEN = 2 : NORMAL = 0 : INVERT = 1
                WAITFORSTART = 128 : SERIALINITDELAY = 5
         END IF

         IF SENDALOW then
                NONE = 0 : ODD = 1 : EVEN = 2 : NORMAL = 0 : INVERT = 1
                WAITFORSTART = 128 : SERIALINITDELAY = 5
         END IF
    #ENDSCRIPT

*SCRIPTS VARIABLES*

Scripting has the concept of variable that can be used within the script.&#160;&#160;
The variables are NOT available as variables to a user program or a library beyond the scope of the script.&#160;&#160;
The variables are available  to a user program as constants.&#160;&#160;
The variables will be integer values, if accessed in a user program.&#160;&#160;


*SCRIPT SYNTAX*

Scripting support the preprocessing of the program to create specific constants.&#160;&#160;
Scripting has a basic syntax and this is detailed in the HELP.&#160;&#160;
However, this guide is intended to provide insights into the gotchas and best practices.

*_Script Insights_*

Scripting handles the creation of specific constants that can be used within the library.&#160;&#160;
Many libraries have script to create constants to support PWM, Serial, HEFSAF etc.&#160;&#160;

You can use the limited script language to complete calculations using real numbers but you MUST ensure the resulting constant is an integer value.&#160;&#160;
Use the IN() method to ensure an integer is assigned.

You can use IF-THEN-ENDIF but if your IF condtional test uses a chip regiseter or a user define constant then you must ensure the register or constant exists.&#160;&#160;
If you do not check the registrer or constant exists the script will fail to operate as expected.&#160;&#160;

There is limted syntax checking.
You must ensure the quality of the script by extensive testing.

----
    int( register +1s))  'Will not create an error, but, simple give an unexpected result.
----
{empty} +
{empty} +


'''

*TAB USAGE AND INDENTING*

Four spaces are to be used. A tab is not permitted

Example follows where the indents are all four spaces.

----
sub  ExampleSub (In VariableName)
    select case VariableName
        case 1
            Do This
        case 2
            Do That
    end select
end sub
----

Not like this:

----
    SUB  ExampleSub (In VariableName)
            Select Case VariableName
                  Case 1
                                   Do This
                  Case 2
                                    Do That
             End Select
End SUB
----

and, not like this

----
    Sub  ExampleSub (In VariableName)
    Select Case VariableName
    Case 1
    Do This
    Case 2
    Do That
    End Select
    End Sub
----

'''

*OPTION REQUIRED*

`#Option Required` supports ensuring the microcontroller has the mandated capabilities, such as EEPROM, HEF, SAF, USART.

Syntax:

----
    #option REQUIRED PIC|AVR CONSTANT %message.dat entry%
    #option REQUIRED PIC|AVR CONSTANT "Message string"
----

This option ensure that the specific CONSTANT exists within a library to ensure a specific capability is available with the microcontroller.

This will cause the compiler check the CONSTANT is a non zero value.  If the CONSTANT does not exist it will be treated as a zero value.

Example:

This example tests the CONSTANT CHIPUSART for both the PIC and AVR microcontrollers.  If the CONSTANT is zero or does not exist then the string will be displayed as an error message.

----
    #option REQUIRED PIC CHIPUSART "Hardware Serial operations. Remove USART commands to resolve errors."
    #option REQUIRED AVR CHIPUSART "Hardware Serial operations. Remove USART commands to resolve errors."
----
