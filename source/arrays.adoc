=== Arrays

*About Arrays*

An array is a special type of variable - one which can store several values at once. It is essentially a list of numbers in which each one can be addressed individually through the use of an "index". 

The numbers can be bytes (the default), longs, integers, or words.  The index is a value in brackets immediately after the name of the array.

All the numbers stored in an array must be of the same type.  For instance, you cannot store bytes and words in the same array.

Examples of array names are:

[cols=2, options="header",width="80%"]

|*Array/Index*
|*Meaning*

|`Fish(10)`
|Definition of an array containing bytes with 10 elements called `Fish`

|`x(5) As Word`
|Definition of an array containing words with 5 elements called `x`

|`DataLog(2)`
|The second element in an array named `DataLog`

|`ButtonList(Temp)`
|An element in the array `ButtonList` that is selected according to the
value in the variable `Temp`

*Defining an array*

Use the DIM command to define an array.

----
    DIM array_title ( number_of_elements ) [As _type_]
----

The number of elements can be number or a constant - not a variable.

The value for the number elements in an array must be a number or constant.
The compiler allocates RAM for arrays at compile time, and therefore you cannot use a variable because during compilation the value of a variable cannot be determined.

*Assigning values to an array*

It is possible to set several elements of a byte array with a single line of code. This short example shows how:

----
    Dim TestVar(10)
    TestVar = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
----

When using this method above element 0 of the array TestVar will be set to the number of items in the list, which in this case is 9. Each element of the array will then be loaded with the corresponding value in the list - so in the example, TestVar(1) will be set to 1, TestVar(2) to 2, and so on.  Element 0 will only be set to number of items in the array when using this method up to 48 data elements.

This only works for *byte* arrays, however.  For arrays of type `integer`, `word`, or `long`, each element must be set separately:

----
    Dim TestVar(5) As Word
    TestVar(1) = 20 
    TestVar(2) = 50
    TestVar(3) = 60
    TestVar(4) = 80
    TestVar(5) = 100
----

If each element has the same value, this can be shortened using a loop:

----
    Dim TestVar(5) As Word
    For i = 1 to 5
        TestVar(i) = 0
    Next
----

*Array Length*

Element 0 should not be used to obtain the length of the array. Element 0 will only be a consistent with respect to the length of the array when the array is set as shown above.

The correct method is to use a constant to set the array size and use the constant within your code to obtain the array length.
----
    #Define ArraySizeConstant 500
    Dim TestVar( ArraySizeConstant )

    SerPrint ArraySizeConstant     'or, other usage
----

*Using Arrays*

To use an array, its name is specified, then the index. Arrays can be used everywhere that a normal variable can be used.

*Maximum Array Size*

The limit on the array size is dependent on the chip type, the amount of RAM, and the number of other variable you use in your program.

Use the following simple program to determine the maximum array size. Set `CHIP` to your device, `MAXSCOPE` to a value which is less the total RAM, and the data type of `test_array` to the data type to be stored in the array.

The data type of `imaxscope` must be set to match the size of the constant `MAXSCOPE`.  If `MAXSCOPE` <= 255, `imaxscope` should be a byte.  If `MAXSCOPE` > 255, `imaxscope` should be a word.

If the array is too large to fit, the compiler will issue an error message.  Reduce MAXSCOPE until the error message is not issued.  The largest `MAXSCOPE` value without an error message is the largest useable array of this type for this chip.

----
    #CHIP   12f1571
    #OPTION Explicit

    #DEFINE MAXSCOPE  111
    DIM     imaxscope As Byte
    DIM     test_array( MAXSCOPE ) As Byte


    For imaxscope = 0 to MAXSCOPE
      test_array( imaxscope ) = imaxscope
    Next
----

For the Atmel AVR, LGT 328p or an 18F array sizes are limited to 10,000 elements.

If a memory limit is reached, the compiler will issue an error message.

*Get the most from the available memory*

Array RAM usage is determined by the architecture of the chip type. Getting most out of the available memory is determined by the allocation of the array within the available banks of memory.

An example is an array of 6 or 7 bytes when there is only 24 bytes of RAM  and the 24 bytes is split across multiple memory banks.  Assume in this example that 18 bytes have allocated to other variables and there is 29 bytes total available.  An array of 6 bytes will fit into the free space in one bank, but the array of 7 will not.

Great Cow BASIC currently cannot split an array over banks, so if there are 6 bytes free in one bank and 5 in another, you cannot have an array of 7 bytes.  This would be very hard to do efficiently on 12F/16F as there would be a series of special function registers in the middle of the array when using a 12F or 16F.   This constraint is not the case on 16F1/18F as linear addressing makes it easy to span banks because the SFRs are not making the problem (as with 12F/16F).

*Using Tables as an alternative.*

If there are many items in the array, it may be better to use a Lookup Table to store the items, and then copy some of the data items into a smaller array as needed.
