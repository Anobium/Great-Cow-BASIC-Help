=== Line Continuation

*About Line Continuation*

A single _ (underscore) character at the end of a line of code tells the compiler that the line continues in the next line.  This allows a single statement (line of code) to be spread across multiple lines in the input file, which can provide nice formatting.

Be careful when adding the _ line continuation character right behind an identifier or keyword. It MUST be separated with at least *one space* character, otherwise it would be treated as part of the identifier or keyword.


*Example:*

    Dim sMyString As String
        sMyString ="one _
                   two _
                   three _
                   four _
                   five _
                   six _
                   seven _
                   eight _
