==== Poke

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    Poke(__location__, __value__)
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

The `Poke` command is used to write information to the on-chip RAM of the microcontroller.

`_location_` is a word variable that gives the address to write. The exact range of valid values varies from chip to chip.
`_value_` is the data to write to the location.

This command should not normally be used, as it will make the porting of code to another chip very difficult.

*Example 1:*
----
    'This program will set all of the PORTB pins high
    POKE (6, 255)
----

*Example 2:*

----
    ;Chip Settings
    #chip 16F88

    Do Forever
        FlashPin @PORTB, 8
        Wait 1 s
    Loop

    Sub FlashPin (In DestVar As word, In DestBit)
        Poke DestVar, Peek(DestVar) Or DestBit
        Wait 1 s
        Poke DestVar, Peek(DestVar) And Not DestBit
    End Sub
----

Using @ before the name of a variable (including a special function register) will give you the address of that variable, which can then be stored in a word variable and used by `Peek` and `Poke` to indirectly access the location.
