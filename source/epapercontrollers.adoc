==== e-Paper Controllers

This section covers GLCD devices known as e-Papers.

An e-paper device is a Microencapsulated Electrophoretic Display, MED.

A MED display uses tiny spheres, in which the charged color pigments are suspending in the transparent oil and would move depending on the electronic charge.&#160;&#160;
The e-paper screen display patterns by reflecting the ambient light, so it has no background light requirement.&#160;&#160;
Under sunshine, the e-paper screen still has high visibility with a wide viewing angle of 180 degree.&#160;&#160;
It is the ideal choice for e-reading or providing information that can be refeshed at a slow rate of change.&#160;&#160;

*Memory Usage*

The Great Cow BASIC library uses RAM to buffer the e-paper display.&#160;&#160;
The amount of RAM used is specific the the total pixel of the specific e-paper display.&#160;&#160;
You can control to amount of RAM used as the buffer using the device specific constants, see below.&#160;&#160;
The library have four memory options.&#160;&#160;
Each of the memory options uses different amount RAM.&#160;&#160;
The greater the amount of RAM used the faster the process of updating the e-paper display.&#160;&#160;
Conversely, the smaller the amount of RAM used the slower the process of updating the e-paper display.&#160;&#160;

*GLCD Page Transactions*

To make the operation of the library seamless - the library supports GLCDTransaction.&#160;&#160;
GLCDTransaction automatically manages the methods to update the e-paper via the buffer, where the buffer can be small.&#160;&#160;
The process of transaction send GLCD commands to the e-paper display on a page and page basis.&#160;&#160;
Each page is the size of the buffer and for a large e-paper display the number of pages may be equivilent to the numbers of pixels high (height).

GLCDTransaction simplies the operation by ensure the buffer is setup correctly, handles the GLCD appropiately, handles the sending of the buffer and then close out the update to the display.  

To use GLCDTransaction use the followng methods.

----
        GLCD_Open_PageTransaction
            ....
            glcd commands
            .....
        
        GLCD_Close_PageTransaction
----

It recommended to use GLCDTransactions at all times.&#160;&#160;These methods remove the complexity of the e-paper update process.

When using GLCDTransaction you must use `GLCD_Open_PageTransaction` then a series of GLCD commands and then `GLCD_Close_PageTransaction`.

WHen using GLCDtransactions as the number of buffer pages may be must greater then 1, then, process of variables and calls to non-GLCD methods must be considered carefully.  As the number of pages may be greater than one the process will increment variables and call non-GLCD methods the same number of times as the number of pages.&#160;&#160;THerefore, design GLCDTransaction operations with this is mind.

*Use of SRAM as the e-paper buffer*

To improve memory usage the e-paper libraries support the use of SRAM.&#160;&#160;
SRAM can be used as an alternative to minimize the amount of allocation RAM.&#160;&#160;
Using SRAM does have a small performance impact but free up the critical resource of the microcontrollers RAM.&#160;&#160;
The use of SRAM within the e-paper library is transparent to the user.&#160;&#160;
To use SRAM as the e-paper buffer you will need to set-up the SRAM library.&#160;&#160;
See the SRAM library for more details on SRAM usage. &#160;&#160;

When using SRAM for the e-paper buffer it is still remcommend to use GLCDTransaction as this ensure the SRAM buffer is correctly initialised.

*Refresh mode*

This library uses Full refresh: The e-Paper will flicker when full refreshing.This flicker removes the ghost image from the display.&#160;&#160;
You could use Partial refresh as this doesnot flicker. Note that you cannot use Partial refresh all the time, you should full refresh e-paper regularly, otherwise, the ghost problem will get worse and even damage the display.&#160;&#160;

*Refresh rate*

When using, you should set the update interval at least 180seconds, except when using Partial mode.&#160;&#160;

Please set the e-Paper to sleep mode in software or remove the power directly, otherwise, the e-Paper will be damaged because of working in high voltage for extendedtime periods.&#160;&#160;
You need to update the content of the e-Paper at least once every 24h to avoid from burn-in problem.&#160;&#160;

*Operating Voltages*

The e-Paper should be driven with 3V3 operating voltages and signals.&#160;&#160;

If your Microcontroller (PIC, AVR and therefore an Arduino)cannot drive the e-Paper successfully. You must convert the level to 3.3V. &#160;&#160;
The I/O level of Arduino is 5V. HEALTH WARNING:You can also try to connect the Vcc pin to the 5V of Arduino to see whether the e-Paper works, but we recommend you not to use 5V for a long time.&#160;&#160;

*The e-Paper looks a little black or grey*

You can try to change the value of Vcom the library by setting the VCOM_AND_DATA_INTERVAL constant.See table 'CDI[3:0]' Vcom and data interval in the dataheet.&#160;&#160;VCOM_AND_DATA_INTERVAL can be 0x00 to 0x0F

*Great Cow BASIC library supports Black/White NOT Black/White/Red*

The default is Black/White. To support Black/White/Red add `#define PANEL_SETTING_KWR 0x00`to you user program.&#160;

The constant can be 0x00 for Black/White/Red. Default is 0x10 for Black/White.&#160;&#160;

*The e-paper has ghosting problem after working for some days*

Please set the e-paper to sleep mode or disconnect it if you do not refresh the e-paper but need to power on your solution.&#160;&#160;

Do NOT leave power on for extended periods, otherwise, the voltage of panel remains high and it will damage the e-paper display.&#160;&#160;


Rules

Remove power if practical.

ALWAYS use `GLCDDisplay Off` or sleep mode.

When in storage CLEAR the screen.... avoid burn it - use

    GLCDDisplay Off

The recommended method is:

    GLCDCLS
    GLCDDisplay Off
    do
    loop



To use the e-Paper driver for a specific simply include the following in your user code.&#160;&#160;
This will initialise the driver.&#160;&#160;
