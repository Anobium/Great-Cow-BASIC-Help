== Frequent errors

[red]#Frequent errors that may happen, from the initial creation of a program and onwards.#

* Strange timings:  You declared an oscillator frequency, different from the oscillator actually attached to the micrcontroller.

* No oscillator:  Keep in mind that, besides the frequency, you must also set the type of oscillator, internal or external.

* No Great Cow BASIC frequency stated:  If not declared in your source program - Great Cow BASIC uses a preset frequency suitable for operating the microcontroller as the fastest practical.

* External oscillators:  It must be explicitly stated, if not stated Great Cow BASIC  will attempt to setup the internal oscillator.

* Ports:  Great Cow BASIC will set the ports automatically but you may need to set the ports outputs or inputs when needed.

* Analog levels:   When applied on the ports defined as digital inputs. can cause current consumption in the input buffer, which is outside the device specifications. Beware.

* Current drawn:  Current taken from the microcontroller outputs, exceeding the maximum allowed (not all pins supply the same current).  Beware of drawing to much current.

* Watchdog Timer (WDT):  The WDT is a useful timer.  Enable to reset the microcontroller when processing can get stuck in a loop.

* Interrupts:  A badly controlled interrupt (in some cases) will prevent the execution of the entire program.

* No action:  The circuit is not powered.

* Still no action:  The microcontroller is not present or different from the device you expected.

* Still no action:  The microcontroller inserted incorrectly in the appropriate socket.

* Cannot program:  Incorrect programmer, Incorrect programmer parameters or circuit connections are incorrect.

* Still Cannot program:  Values of excessively incorrect circuit resistances.

* Serial Communcations:  The TX and RX pins of the serial port are exchanged, and/or the connections with the level converter, ttl / rs232 or ttl / usb.

* Stlll no Serial Communcations:  Serial speed, different from the one set in the circuit with which it is intended to communicate or vice versa.

* No I2C/TWI:   SDL and/or SCL pin exchanged on the I2C/TWI bus connection, and/or no pull-up resistors, and/or no common 0 voltage.

* Incorrect timing:  Calculation of any timings related to the frequency of the external oscillator, without taking into account the division by 4.

* Strange Numeric Values:  The variables declared are insufficient to contain the values ​​to be processed.
