==== More on setting Variables and Constants

*Explanation*

Within Great Cow BASIC you can use regular variable assignments. But, you can also use C like maths assignments.

The following methods are also supported.
----
    GLCDPrintLoc += 6
    CharCode -= 15
    CharCode++
    CharCode---
----

Within Great Cow BASIC you can define binary, hexidecimal and decimal constants, see <<_constants,Constants>>. Please note what is and what is not support with respect to assigning numbers to constants. An example program examines what is supported.

----
    #chip 16F88, 4
    #config Osc = INT, MCLRE_OFF

    ' All these work
    #define Test0 b'11111111'
    #define Test1 0b11111111
    #define Test2 0B11111111
    #define Test3 255
    #define Test4 0xFF
    #define Test5 0xff
    #define Test6 0Xff

    # Proof
    dir porta Out

    porta = test0
    porta = test1
    porta = test2
    porta = test3
    porta = test4
    porta = test5
    porta = test6
----
You can assigned values/numbers with all the methods shown above (for constants and variables) but please be aware that you must Use '0' not '00'. One zero equates to zero and two zeros will give you an unassigned variable.

*Constants:*

A few critical constants are defined within Great Cow BASIC , you can re-use these constants. They include:

----
    #define ON 1       ' These are defined in System.h
    #define OFF 0
    #define TRUE 255
    #define FALSE 0

    #define OSC = 1    ' These are defined in TIMER.H
    #define EXT = 2    ' and, are used by InitTimer0 command
    #define EXTOSC = 3
