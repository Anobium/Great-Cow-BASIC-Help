==== ProgramWrite

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]

----
    ProgramWrite (_location_, _value_)
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all Microchip PIC microcontrollers with self write capability. Not available on
Atmel AVR at present.

*Explanation:*

`ProgramWrite` writes information to the program memory on chips that
support this feature. `_location_` and `_value_` are both word variables.

The largest value possible for `_location_` depends on the amount of
program memory on the microcontroller , which is given on the datasheet. `_value_` is
14 bits wide, and thus can store values up to 16383.

This is an advanced command which should only be used by advanced
developers. ProgramErase must be used to clear a block of memory BEFORE
`ProgramWrite` is called.
