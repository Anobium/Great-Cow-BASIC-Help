==== T6963 Controllers

This section covers Graphical Liquid Crystal Display (GLCD) devices that use the Toshiba T6963 graphics controller.&#160;&#160;&#160;The T6963 is a monochrome device that typically is blue or white.&#160;&#160;&#160;The GLCD can be provided in a number of pixels sizes - 240 * 64 or 240 * 128.

The Toshiba T6963 is a very popular LCD controller for use in small graphics modules. It is capable of controlling displays with a resolution up to 240x128. Because of its low power and
small outline it is most suitable for mobile applications such as PDAs, MP3 players or mobile measurement equipment.

{empty} +
A number of GLCD  modules have this controller built-in these include the SP12N002 & SP14N001. Although this controller is small, it has the capability of displaying
and merging text and graphics and it manages all the interfacing signals to the displays Row and Column drivers.&#160;&#160;&#160;The Great Cow BASIC library supports the complex capabilities of the T6963.

{empty} +
The T6963 is an LCD is driven by on-board 5V parallel interface chipset T6963.&#160;&#160;&#160;For the specific operating voltage always verify the operating voltages in the device specific datasheet.

{empty} +
The Great Cow BASIC connectivity option is the 8-bit mode - where 8 connections (for the data) are required between the microcontroller and the GLCD to control the data bus.

To use the T6963 driver simply include the following in your user code.  &#160;&#160;&#160;This will initialise the driver.

The T6963 differs from most other GLCD controllers in its use of the display RAM.&#160;&#160;&#160; Where a fixed area
of memory is normally allocated for text, graphics and the external character generator, but with
the T6963 the size for each area *MUST* be set by software commands.&#160;&#160;&#160; This means that the area for
text, graphics and external character generator can be freely allocated within the external
memory, up to 64 kByte.&#160;&#160;&#160;Check the specific device for the amount of memory available.&#160;&#160;&#160;This can range from 4 kbyte to 64 kbyte.
