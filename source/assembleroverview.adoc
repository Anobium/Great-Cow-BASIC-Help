=== Assembler Overview

*Introduction:*

You can use microcontroller assembler code within your Great Cow BASIC code.

You can put the assembler code inline in with your source code. The assembler code will be passed through to the assembly file associated with your project.

Great Cow BASIC should recognise all of the commands in the microcontroller datasheet.

The commands should be in lower case, this is good practice, and have a space or tab in front of the command.

Even if the mnemonics are not being formatted properly, `gputils/MPASM` should still be capable of assembling the source code.

Format commands as follows:

*Example:*

----
  btfsc STATUS,Z
  bsf PORTB,1
----
