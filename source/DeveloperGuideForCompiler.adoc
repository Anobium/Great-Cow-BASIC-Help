*BACKGROUND*

The compiler was created by Dr. Hugh Considine when he was 12 years old.&#160;&#160;That was in 2005.&#160;&#160;Hugh came up with the idea for a new compiler - of the then available compilers - they were hard to use and not free. &#160;&#160;And, he had some spare time.

Hugh believes that Great Cow BASIC should be free to all - forever.&#160;&#160;


The original software was called GCBASIC, but, he had some resistance in getting high schools in Australia to use and agree to the use of text based programming.&#160;&#160;
Great Cow Graphical BASIC was created to address the need for a graphical user interface.&#160;&#160;Great Cow Graphical BASIC acts like a set of training wheels. &#160;&#160;
The concept of Great Cow Graphical BASIC is that the icons make it less scary, and since they all share names with the BASIC commands it is then easy to remember what command corresponds to each icon..&#160;&#160;
Using Great Cow Graphical BASIC users can then switch to text mode whenever they want to, go backwards and forwards a few times if they want, and finally end up using just the text programming.&#160;&#160;
It is a journey from a graphical user interface to text based programming.&#160;&#160;
{empty} +
{empty} +
Those who already have programming experience can go straight to Great Cow BASIC, while those who would prefer a lighter learning curve can take the Great Cow Graphical BASIC option. &#160;&#160;
The two approaches targets two different sets of users who ultimately want to do the same thing.

As for the *name*, it was about the fourth name Hugh tried. &#160;&#160;First name was BASPIC, but it did not seem memorable enough.&#160;&#160;
Then, he considered some animal names - first thought was Chipmunk BASIC, but someone already used that!&#160;&#160;
Then, Bear BASIC, but decided against it on finding out the slang meaning of bear.&#160;&#160;
Final  name was Great Cow BASIC, which is named after something his sister and he came up with (when aged 12 and 15!!).&#160;&#160;
No-one else had that name, it had no meanings that could offend, and it was something odd enough to be memorable, so Great Cow BASIC it was.

In 2013 Evan Venn joined the team as a compiler developer, with others joining in Bernd Dau, Trevor Roydhouse, Pete Everett, Theo Loermans, Giuseppe D'Elia, Derek Gore,  Ian Smith, Bernd Dau, Theo Loermans, Urs Hopp, Kent Schafer, and Frank Steinberg.&#160;&#160;
Some those that joined in drove changes to the compiler, some changed the source code, some built tools and some built libraries.&#160;&#160;
They all had one thing in common - improvements to the Great Cow BASIC compiler.

In 2021 we are still having new developers join the project like ToniG adding a new capability for handling Tables.

*THE COMPILER*

The compiler executable is called GCBASIC.EXE. &#160;&#160;
The compiler source is written in FreeBASIC.&#160;&#160;
FreeBASIC is a multiplatform, free/open source (GPL) BASIC programming language and a compiler for Microsoft Windows, protected-mode MS-DOS (DOS extender), Linux and FreeBSD.
&#160;&#160;
{empty} +
{empty} +
The official website is https://www.freebasic.net/[https://www.freebasic.net/]
{empty} +
{empty} +
FreeBASIC provides syntax compatibility with programs originally written in Microsoft QuickBASIC (QB).&#160;&#160;
FreeBASIC is a command line only compiler, unless users manually install an external integrated development environment (IDE) of their choice.&#160;&#160;
IDEs specifically made for FreeBASIC include FBide and FbEdit, while more graphical options include WinFBE Suite and VisualFBEditor.&#160;&#160;
{empty} +
{empty} +
The source code is Open Source.&#160;&#160;
And, has a GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.&#160;&#160;
{empty} +
{empty} +
The source code for the compiler can be found on https://sourceforge.net/p/gcbasic/code/HEAD/tree/GCBASIC/trunk/[SourceForge]
{empty} +
{empty} +
Use SVN to UPDATE and COMMIT code changes.&#160;&#160;
You require developer access to SourceForge but if you have got this far then you already know this.&#160;&#160;
You are therefore  required to use SVN for source code management.

When COMMITting you MUST update the change log, then, when you commit an update use the change log with the SourceForge commit number.&#160;&#160;
Then, add the new change at the end of the change log.&#160;&#160;
The COMMIT message should be the same as the description in the change log.&#160;&#160;
Add the [_COMMIT NUMBER]_ to the description in the change log to show the COMMIT number.&#160;&#160;


You will find the changelog https://onedrive.live.com/Edit.aspx?resid=2F87FFE77F3DBEC7!67634&wd=cpe&authkey=!ADmkT3exl5l4Pkc[here].&#160;&#160;
The change log is an EXCEL spreadsheet.&#160;&#160;

*COMPILER ARCHITECTURE*

The compiler is relatively simple in terms of the architecture.&#160;&#160;
There is a main source program with a set of header files that contain other methods or declarations.&#160;&#160;
The GCBASIC header files are the following:

----
    1. preprocessor.bi -  methods, statements, defines, declarations, prototypes, constants, enumerations, or similar types of statements
    2. utils.bi - methods that are shared across the architecture
    3. variables.bi - methods that control the creation and management of variables
    4. assembly.bi - methods specific to the generation of Great Cow Assembler (GCASM)
    5. file.bi - the FreeBASIC files library
    6. string.bi - the FreeBASIC string library
----
The supporting files are:

----
    1. messages.dat - the English messages source file.  All user messages from the compiler are sourced from this file.
    2. reservedwords.dat - the list of system reserved words
----
{empty} +
{empty} +
The compiler process is simple.&#160;&#160;
The process, shown below, generates the ASM source and the HEX file from the user source program.

----
    1. Create the indexes
    2. Declare the methods, arrays and variables
    3. Process the user source programs using PreProcessor method
    4. Compile the program using the CompileProgram method
    5. Allocate RAM using the AllocateRAM method
    6. Optimise the generated code using the TidyProgram method
    7. Combine and locate the subroutines and functions for the selected chip using the MergeSubroutines method
    8. Complete the final optimisation using the FinalOptimise method
    9. Write the assembly using the WriteAssembly method
    10. Assemble and generate the hex file using GCASM, MPASM, PICAS or some other define Assembler
    11. Optionally, pass programming operations to the programmer
    12. Write compilation report using the WriteCompilationReport method
    13. If needed, write the error and warning log using the WriteErrorLog method
    14. Exit, setting the ERRORLEVEL

*CODING STYLES*

Remember, Hugh was 12 when he started this project.&#160;&#160;
You must forgive him for being a genius, but, he did not implement many programming styles and conventions that are common place today.&#160;&#160;

There is a general lack of documentation.&#160;&#160;
We are adding documentation as we progress.&#160;&#160;
This can make the source frustrating initially but can find the code segments as they are clearly within method blocks.&#160;&#160;

The following rules are recommended.

----
    1. All CONSTANTS are capitalized
    2. Do not use TAB - use two spaces
    3. You can rename a variable to a meaningful name.  Hugh used a lot of single character variables many years ago.  This should be avoided in new code.
    4. Document as you progress.
    5. Ask for help.

----

{empty} +


*COMPILER SOURCE INSIGHTS*

_There are many very useful methods_, a lot of methods, look at existing code before adding any new method.&#160;&#160;
The compiler is mature from a functionality standpoint.&#160;&#160;
Just immature in terms of documentation.&#160;&#160;

_To isolate a specific issue_ use a binary chop and lots of debug using PRINT.&#160;&#160;
Whilst, this may not be ideal this is the best approach.&#160;&#160;

_Revert_ code using SVN to remove all debug!.&#160;&#160;Do not leave debug in the source code.&#160;&#160;

=== Development Guide for Great Cow BASIC Preferences Editor

This section deals with the Great Cow BASIC Preferences Editor (Pref Editor).&#160;&#160;
The Prefs Editor is the software enables the user to select programmers, select the options when compiling, select the assembler and other settings.&#160;&#160;

The software is developed using Sharp Develop v.3.2.1 ( not Visual Studio ).&#160;&#160;

{empty} +

*ABOUT THE PREFS EDITOR*

This is a utility for editing GCBASIC ini files.&#160;&#160;
It is derived from the Great Cow Graphical BASIC utilities, and requires some files from Great Cow Graphical BASIC to compile.&#160;&#160;

{empty} +

*COMPILING*

Ensure that the "Programmer Editor" folder is in the same folder as a "Great Cow Graphical BASIC" folder.&#160;&#160;
The "Great Cow Graphical BASIC" folder must contain the following files from GCGB:
 - Preferences.vb
 - PreferencesWindow.vb
 - ProgrammerEditor.vb
 - Translator.vb
 - ProgrammerEditor.resources

Once these files are in place, it should be possible to compile the Programmer Editor using SharpDevelop 3.2 (or similar).

{empty} +

*USING PREFS EDITOR*

If run without any parameters, this program will create an ini file in whatever directory it is located in.&#160;&#160;
If it is given the name of an ini file as a command line parameter, it will use that file.&#160;&#160;

As well as the ini file it is told to load, this program will also read any files that are included from that file..&#160;&#160;
This makes it possible to keep the settings file in the Application Data folder if GCBASIC is installed in the Program Files directory..&#160;&#160;
To put the settings file into the Application Data folder, create a small ini file containing the following 3 lines and place it in the same directory as this program:

----
    include %appdata%\gcgb.ini
    [gcgb]
    useappdata = true
----

The include line tells the program (and GCBASIC) to read from the Application Data folder.&#160;&#160;
The useappdata=true line in the [gcgb] section will cause this program to write any output to a file in Application Data called gcgb.ini.&#160;&#160;
The hard coding of GCGB is required this program is based on GCGB.&#160;&#160;
It will result in programmer definitions being shared between GCGB and any other environment using this editor, which may be a positive side effect.

----
        1. Download and install Sharp Develop from  https://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpdevelop/files/SharpDevelop%203.x/3.2/[SourceForge]
        2. Download the Prefs Editor source using SVN into a source folder.  This is the folder ..\utils\Programmer Editor
        4. Run Sharp Develop (installed at step #1).  Load project  "Programmer Editor.sln"  from source source folder.
        5. Hit <f8> to compile.
