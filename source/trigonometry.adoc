==== Trigonometry Sine, Cosine and Tangent

*Syntax*:
[subs="quotes"]
----
    byte_variable = sin( __word_variable__ )

    byte_variable = cos( __word_variable__ )

    byte_variable = tan( __word_variable__ )

*Explanation*:

Great Cow BASIC supports Three Primary Trigonometric Functions

Great Cow BASIC supports the following functions, sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), where x is a signed integer representing an angle measured in a whole number of degrees. The output values are also integers, represented as fixed point decimal fractions.

*Details:*

The sine, cosine and tangent functions are available for your programs simply by including the header file offering the precision you need.
----
    #INCLUDE <TRIG2PLACES.H> gives two decimal places
    #INCLUDE <TRIG3PLACES.H> gives three decimal places
    #INCLUDE <TRIG4PLACES.H> gives four decimal places
----
In fixed point representation, the decimal point is assumed. For example, with two places of accuracy, sin(60) returns 87, which you would interpret as 0.87. With three places, 866 is returned, to be interpreted as 0.866, and so on. Another way of thinking of this is to consider the two-place values as scaled up by 100, the three-place values scaled up by 1000 and the four-place values scaled up by 10,000.

Sine and cosine are always defined, but remember that tangent fails to exist at 90 degrees, 270 degrees and all their coterminal angles. It is the responsibility of the calling program to avoid these special values.

Note that the tangent function is not available to four decimal places, since its value grows so rapidly, exceeding what the Integer data type can represent.

These routines are completely general. The input argument may be positive, negative or zero, with no restriction on the size. Further observe that lookup tables are used, so the routines are very fast, efficient and accurate.
