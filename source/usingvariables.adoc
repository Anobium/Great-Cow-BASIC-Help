==== Using Variables

*Explaination*

Using and accessing bytes within word and long numbers etc may be required when you are creating your solution. This can be done with some ease.

You can access the bytes within word and longs variables using the following as a guide using the Suffixes `_H`, `_U` and `_E`
----
    Dim workvariable as word
    workvariable = 21845
    Dim lowb as byte
    Dim highb as byte
    Dim upperb as byte
    Dim lastb as byte

    lowb = workvariable
    highb = workvariable_H
    upperb = workvariable_U
    lastb = workvariable_E
----

To further explain, where

----
    Dim rB as Byte
    Dim sW as Word
    Dim sW as Word
----

To extract the bytes from a WORD of 16 bits use the Suffix `_H`

----
    'To use the bits 7-0 [lower byte] in the Word variable sW
    rB = sW

    'For bits 15-8 [upper byte] in the Word variable sW, use sw_H
    rB = sW_H
----

To extract the bytes from a LONG of 32 bits use the Suffixes `_H`, `_U` and
`_E`, where

----
    Dim rB as Byte
    Dim sW as Word
    Dim tL as Long

    ‘ For bits 7-0 [lowest byte #0] in Long variable tL
    rB = tL

    ‘ For bits 15-8 [lower middle byte #1] in Long variable tL
    rB = tL_H

    ‘ For bits 23-16 [upper middle byte #2] in Long variable tL
    rB = tL_U

    ‘ For bits 31-24 [highest byte #3] in Long variable tL
    rB = tL_E
----

To extract nibbles from the variable `rB`

----
    lower_nibble = rB & 0x0F
    upper_nibble = (rB & 0xF0) / 16
