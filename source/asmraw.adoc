=== #asmraw

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]

    #asmraw [label]
    #asmraw [Mnemonics | Directives | Macros] [Operands] ['comments]
----
*Explanation:*

The `#asmraw` directive is used to specify the assembly that Great Cow BASIC will use.&#160;&#160;&#160;
Anything following this directive will be inserted into ASM source file with no changes other than trimming spaces - no replacement of constants.&#160;&#160;&#160;


Assembly is a programming language you may use to develop the source code for your application.&#160;&#160;&#160;
The directive must conform to the following basic guidelines.&#160;&#160;&#160;
Each line of the source file may contain up to four types of information:&#160;&#160;&#160;
• Labels
• Mnemonics, Directives and Macros
• Operands
• Comments
The order and position of these are important. For ease of debugging, it is recommended that labels start in column one and mnemonics start in column two or
beyond. Operands follow the mnemonic.&#160;&#160;&#160;
Comments may follow the operands, mnemonics or labels, and can start in any column. The maximum column width is 255 characters.&#160;&#160;&#160;
White space or a colon must separate the label and the mnemonic, and white space must separate the mnemonic and the operand(s).&#160;&#160;&#160;
Multiple operands must beseparated by commas.&#160;&#160;&#160;
White space is one or more spaces or tabs. White space is used to separate pieces of a source line.
&#160;&#160;&#160;
White space should be used to make your code easier for people to read.&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unless within character constants, any white space means the same as exactly one space.

*Example*
----
         #asmraw lds SysValueCopy,TCCR0B
         #asmraw andi SysValueCopy, 0xf8
         #asmraw inc SysValueCopy
         #asmraw sts TCCR0B, SysValueCopy

----

This example will generate the following in the ASM source file.
----
        lds SysValueCopy,TCCR0B
        andi  SysValueCopy, 0xf8
        inc SysValueCopy
        sts TCCR0B, SysValueCopy
