=== Serial/RS232 Buffer Ring

// Edit EvanV 01092016 to show buffer element 0 can be part of the buffer.

*Explanation:*

This program demonstrates how to create a serial input buffer ring.

The program receives a character into the buffer and sends back.  Try sending large volumes of characters.....

This program program uses an interrupt event to capture the incoming byte value and place in the buffer ring. When a byte is received the buffer ring is incremented to ensuer the next byte is handled correctly.

Testing `bkbhit` will set to True when a byte has been received. Reading the function `bgetc` will return the last byte received.

*Demonstration program:*

This demonstration program will support up to 256 bytes. For a larger buffer change the variables to words.
