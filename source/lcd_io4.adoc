===== LCD_IO 4

*Using connection mode 4:*

To use connection mode 4 the R/W, RS, Enable control lines and the highest 4 data lines (DB4 through DB7) must be connected to the microcontroller.

*Relevant Constants:*

Specific constants are used to control settings for the Liquid Crystal Display routines included with Great Cow BASIC.  To set these constants the main program should specific constants to support the connection mode using #define.
Constants required for connection mode 4.

Constants are required for 4-bit mode as follows.
[cols=3, options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|*Constant Name*
|*Controls*
|*Default Value*

|`LCD_SPEED`
|`FAST`, `MEDIUM` or `SLOW`.
|`MEDIUM`

|`LCD_IO`
|Must be *4*
|`4`

|`LCD_RS`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to Register Select on the
LCD.
|*_Must be defined_*

|`LCD_RW`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to Read/Write on the LCD. The
R/W pin can be disabled*.
|*_Must be defined_* _(unless R/W is disabled)_

|`LCD_Enable`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to Read/Write on the LCD.
|*_Must be defined_*

|`LCD_DB4`
|Output pin used to interface with bit 4 of the LCD data bus
|*_Must be defined_*

|`LCD_DB5`
|Output pin used to interface with bit 5 of the LCD data bus
|*_Must be defined_*

|`LCD_DB6`
|Output pin used to interface with bit 6 of the LCD data bus
|*_Must be defined_*

|`LCD_DB7`
|Output pin used to interface with bit 7 of the LCD data bus
|*_Must be defined_*

|===

The `R/W` pin can be disabled by setting the `LCD_NO_RW` constant. If this
is done, there is no need for the `R/W` to be connected to the chip, and
no need for the `LCD_RW` constant to be set. Ensure that the `R/W` line on
the LCD is connected to ground if not used.
