*Explanation:*

Peripheral Pin Select (PPS) has an operation mode in which all input and output selections can be prevented to stop  inadvertent changes.

PPS selections are locked by setting by the use of the `LockPPS` command.

Using this command will ensure the special sequence of Microchip assembler is handled correctly.

*Command Availability:*

Available on all Microchip microcontrollers only.
