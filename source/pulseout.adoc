==== PulseOut

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    PulseOut __pin__, __time units__
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

The `PulseOut` command will set the specified pin high, wait for the specified amount of time, and then set the pin low again. The pin is specified in the same way as it is for the Set command, and the time is the same as for the `Wait` command.

*Example:*
----
    'This program flashes an LED on GPIO.0 using PulseOut
    #chip 12F629, 4
    #config INTRC_OSC_NOCLKOUT

    Dir GPIO.0 Out
    Do
        PulseOut GPIO.0, 1 sec 'Turn LED on for 1 sec
        Wait 1 sec             'Wait 1 sec with LED off
    Loop
