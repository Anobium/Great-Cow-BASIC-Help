==== Do

*Syntax:*
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]

----
    Do [{While | Until} _condition_]
    ...
    _program code_
    ...
    _<condition>_ Exit Do
    ...
    Loop [{While | Until} _condition_]
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

The `Do` command will cause the code between the `Do` and the `Loop` to run
repeatedly while `_condition_` is true or until `_condition_` is true,
depending on whether `While` or `Until` has been specified.

Note that the `While` or `Until` and the condition can only be specified
once, or not at all. If they are not specified, then the code will
repeat endlessly.

Optionally, you can specify a condition to `EXIT` the `Do-Loop` immediately.

*Example 1:*

----
    'This code will flash a light until the button is pressed
    #chip 12F629, 4
    #config osc = int

    #define BUTTON GPIO.3
    #define LIGHT GPIO.5

    Dir BUTTON In
    Dir LIGHT Out

    Do Until BUTTON = 1
    	PulseOut LIGHT, 1 s
    	Wait 1 s
    Loop
----

*Example 2:*

This code will also flash a light until the button is pressed. This
example uses `EXIT DO` within a continuous loop.

----
    #chip 12F629, 4
    #config osc = int

    #define BUTTON GPIO.3
    #define LIGHT GPIO.5

    Dir BUTTON In
    Dir LIGHT Out

    Do
    	PulseOut LIGHT, 1 s
    	Wait 1 s
    	if BUTTON = 1 then EXIT DO
    Loop
