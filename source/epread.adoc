*Command Availability:*

Available on all Microchip PIC and Atmel AVR microcontrollers with EEPROM data memory.

*Explanation:*

`EPRead` is used to read information from the EEPROM data storage that
many microcontroller chips are equipped with. `_location_` represents the
location to read data from, and varies from one chip to another. `_store_`
is the variable in which to store the data after it has been read from
EEPROM.

*Example:*

----
    'Program to turn a light on and off
    'Will remember the last status

    #chip tiny2313, 1
    #define Button PORTB.0
    #define Light PORTB.1

    Dir Button In
    Dir Light Out

    'Load saved status
    EPRead 0, LightStatus

    If LightStatus = 0 Then
      Set Light Off
    Else
      Set Light On
    End If

    Do
      'Wait for the button to be pressed
      Wait While Button = On
      Wait While Button = Off
      'Toggle value, record
      LightStatus = !LightStatus
      EPWrite 0, LightStatus

      'Update light
      If LightStatus = 0 Then
        Set Light Off
      Else
        Set Light On
      End If
