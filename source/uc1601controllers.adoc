==== UC1601 Controllers


This section covers GLCD devices that use the UC1601 graphics controller.

The UC1601 is an advanced high-voltage mixed signal CMOS IC, especially designed for the display needs of ultra-low power hand-held devices.

The UC1601 embeds with contrast control, display RAM and oscillator, which reduces the number of external components and power consumption.&#160;&#160; It has 256-step brightness control. Data/Commands are sent from general MCU through the hardware selectable 6800/8000 series compatible Parallel Interface, I2C interface or Serial Peripheral Interface. It is suitable for many compact portable applications, such as mobile phone sub-display, MP3 player and calculator, etc.

The UC1601 library supports 132 * 22 pixels.&#160;&#160;  The UC1601 library  supports monochrome devices.

The UC1601 can operate in three modes.&#160;&#160; Full GLCD mode, Low Memory GLCD mode or Text/JPG mode the full GLCD mode requires a minimum of 396k bytes or 128 bytes for the respective modes.&#160;&#160;For microcontrollers with limited memory the third mode of operation - Text mode.  These can be selected by setting the correct constant.

To use the UC1601 driver simply include the following in your user code.  This will initialise the driver.

The Great Cow BASIC constants shown below control the configuration of the UC1601 controller. &#160;&#160;&#160;Great Cow BASIC supports hardware I2C & software I2C connectivity  - this is shown in the tables below.


To use the UC1601 drivers simply include one of the following configuration.

|`GLCD_OLED_FONT`
|Specifies the use of the optional OLED font set.

The GLCDfntDefaultsize can be set to 1 or 2 only.

`GLCDfntDefaultsize=  1`.   A small 8 height pixel font with variable width.
`GLCDfntDefaultsize=  2`.   A larger 10 width * 16 height pixel font.

|Optional



|===

The Great Cow BASIC variables for control display characteristics are shown in the table below.
These variables control the user definable parameters of a specific GLCD.
[cols=3, options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|*Variable*
|*Purpose*
|*Type*

|`GLCDBackground`
|GLCD background state.

|`GLCDForeground`
|Color of GLCD foreground.
|A monochrome value. +
For mono GLCDs the default is non-white or 0x0000.

|`GLCDFontWidth`
|Width of the current GLCD font.
|Default is 6 pixels.

|`GLCDfntDefault`
|Size of the current GLCD font.
|Default is 0.


This equates to the standard GCB font set.

|`GLCDfntDefaultsize`
|Size of the current GLCD font.
|Default is 1.


This equates to the 8 pixel high.
