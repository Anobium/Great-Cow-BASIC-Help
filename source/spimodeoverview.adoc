==== SPI Overview

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]

The SPI interface allows for the transmission and receiption of data simultaneously on two lines (MOSI and MISO).

The Clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA) are the main parameters that define a clock format to be used by the SPI bus. Depending on CPOL parameter, SPI clock may be inverted or non-inverted. CPHA parameter is used to shift the sampling phase. If CPHA=0 the data are sampled on the leading (first) clock edge. If CPHA=1 the data are sampled on the trailing (second) clock edge, regardless of whether that clock edge is rising or falling.

CPOL=0, CPHA=0

The data must be available before the first clock signal rising.  The clock idle state is zero.  The data on MISO and MOSI lines must be stable while the clock is high and can be changed when the clock is low. The data is captured on the clock's low-to-high transition and propagated on high-to-low clock transition.

CPOL=0, CPHA=1

The first clock signal rising can be used to prepare the data. The clock idle state is zero. The data on MISO and MOSI lines must be stable while the clock is low and can be changed when the clock is high. The data is captured on the clock's high-to-low transition and propagated on low-to-high clock transition.

CPOL=1, CPHA=0

The data must be available before the first clock signal falling. The clock idle state is one. The data on MISO and MOSI lines must be stable while the clock is low and can be changed when the clock is high. The data is captured on the clock's high-to-low transition and propagated on low-to-high clock transition.

*Key Commands*

----

    SPIMode  ( _Mode_ [, SPIClockMode])

    SPITransfer (  _OutByte_, _InByte_ )

    FastHWSPITransfer( _OutByte_ )

    #define HWSPIMode MASTERULTRAFAST       'MASTERSLOW | MASTER | MASTERFAST | MASTERULTRAFAST for specific AVRs only.
                                            'Defaults to MASTERFAST when microcontroller frequency less or equal to 32 mhz
                                            'Defaults to MASTER when microcontroller frequency more than 32 mhz.
----

The Great Cow BASIC used the microcontrollers hardware module for SPI.  The example below shows an implementation of Hardware and Software SPI.  Software SPI allows for a greater choice of ports to be used to control the SPI operations.

*Example*

This example demonstrates the SPI capabilities for the mega328p.  The process is similar of any microcontroller..

This example show using the hardware SPI option and a sofware SPI option.

Using hardware SPI mode - make sure the `#define SPI_HardwareSPI` is not commented out.
Using software SPI mode - comment out `#define SPI_HardwareSPI`. The example code will then use software SPI.

*Setting the SPI Mode*

Hardware SPI mode the Data Out, Data In and Clock (DO/DI and SCK) cannot be moved but the optional Data Command, Chip Select and Reset are all moveable.

Software SPI mode the Data Out, Data In and Clock (DO/DI and SCK), Data Command, Chip Select and Reset are all moveable.

Use the constant `HWSPIMode` to set the SPI frequency when using Great Cow BASIC libraries.

----
    #define HWSPIMode MASTERULTRAFAST
----

Great Cow BASIC libraries will default to to MASTERFAST when microcontroller frequency less or equal to 32 mhz and default to MASTER when microcontroller frequency more than 32 mhz.

The options for `HWSPIMode` are:

`MASTERSLOW`, or, `MASTER` or `MASTERFAST` or `MASTERULTRAFAST` for specific AVRs only.

This constant sets the library to the desire SPI fequency, therefore enable adaption of the SPI frequency without have to change the library.

The SPI frequnecy must be the same for all the used devices.&#160;&#160; In particular, it must be set equal to the one dictated by the slowest SPI device to be used.

More freedom is available when more than an hardware SPI is available as well as when the user want to use hardware SPI for a device and software SPI for a second one.


*Using multiple SPI devices*

There will be use cases were you need to use more than one SPI target device at a time.&#160;&#160;In such cases the device defined for SPI must be inserted in your program for each device.

As an example using e-Paper and SRAM at the same time, with an hardware SPI would require `#define SPISRAM_HARDWARESPI` and `#define EPD_HardwareSPI`.&#160;&#160;

Obviously, when all SPI devices use the same SPI lines, you must  select one device at a time by setting SPI Chip Select line to `OFF` for the specific target SPI device, and you must set `ON` the SPI Chip Select line for any other SPI device&#160;&#160;-&#160;&#160;this is a normal convention of SPI usage. &#160;&#160; This is not specific to Great Cow BASIC..


*Code overview*

    InitSPIMode calls SPIMode. if needed, when hardware mode, and set the port firections.
    The sub SendByteviaSPI is called to handle whether to call the Hardware or use Software (bit-banging) SPI.
