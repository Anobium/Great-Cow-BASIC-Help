==== Keypad Overview

*Introduction*

The keypad routines allow for a program to read from a 4 x 4 matrix
keypad.

There are two ways that the keypad routines can be set up. One option is
to connect the wires from the keypad in a particular order, and then to
set the KeypadPort constant. The other option is to connect the keypad
in whatever way is easiest, and then set the `KEYPAD_ROW_x` and
`KEYPAD_COL_x` constants. The option (setting `KeypadPort`) will
generate slightly more efficient code.

*Configuration using* `KEYPAD_ROW_x` *and* `KEYPAD_COL_x`:

These constants must be set:
[cols=3, options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|*Constant Name*
|*Controls*
|*Default Value*

|`KEYPAD_ROW_1`
|The pin on the microcontroller that connects to the Row 1 pin on the
keypad
|N/A

|`KEYPAD_ROW_2`
|The pin on the microcontroller that connects to the Row 2 pin on the
keypad
|N/A

|`KEYPAD_ROW_3`
|The pin on the microcontroller that connects to the Row 3 pin on the
keypad
|N/A

|`KEYPAD_ROW_4`
|The pin on the microcontroller that connects to the Row 4 pin on the
keypad
|N/A

|`KEYPAD_COL_1`
|The pin on the microcontroller that connects to the Col 1 pin on the
keypad
|N/A

|`KEYPAD_COL_2`
|The pin on the microcontroller that connects to the Col 2 pin on the
keypad
|N/A

|`KEYPAD_COL_3`
|The pin on the microcontroller that connects to the Col 3 pin on the
keypad
|N/A

|`KEYPAD_COL_4`
|The pin on the microcontroller that connects to the Col 4 pin on the
keypad
|N/A
|===
If using a 3 x 3 keypad, do not set the `KEYPAD_ROW_4` or `KEYPAD_COL_4`
constants.

*Configuration using* `KeypadPort`:

When setting up the keypad code using the `KeypadPort` constant, only
`KeypadPort` needs to be set.

Pull-ups or pull-downs go on the columns only, and are typically 4.7k to
10k in value.
[cols=3, options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|*Constant Name*
|*Controls*
|*Default Value*

|`KeypadPort`
|The port on the microcontroller chip that the keypad is connected to.
|N/A
|===
*Configuration when using Pull down resistors*

The keypad routine has a feature when using pull-down resistors, simply
add the constant to your program and the and the scan logic will be
inverted appropriately.
[cols=3, options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|*Constant Name*
|*Controls*
|*Default Value*

|`KEYPAD_PULLDOWN`
|Support pull down resistors.
|N/A
|===

For this to work, the keypad must be connected as follows:
[cols=2, options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|*Microcontroller port pin*
|*Keypad connector*

|0
|Row 1

|1
|Row 2

|2
|Row 3

|3
|Row 4

|4
|Column 1

|5
|Column 2

|6
|Column 3

|7
|Column 4

Note: To use a 3 x 3 keypad in this mode, the pins on the
microcontroller for any unused columns must be pulled up.
