==== HPWM_CCPTimerN

*Syntax:*
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
    HPWM_CCPTimerN _channel_, _frequency_, _duty cycle_ [, _timer_ 2, 4 or 6 ]
----
*Command Availability:*

Only available on Microchip PIC microcontrollers with Capture/Compare/PWM (CCP)
module.

This command supports the CCP 8 bit support with *Timer 2, 4 or 6 only*. +

*Explanation:*

This command sets up the hardware PWM module of the Microchip PIC microcontroller to generate
a PWM waveform of the given frequency and duty cycle. +

If you only need one particular frequency and duty cycle, you should use PWMOn and
the constants PWM_Freq and PWM_Duty instead.

`_channel_` is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, and corresponds to the pins CCP1, CCP2, CCP3, CCP4 and CCP5
respectively. On chips with only one CCP port, pin CCP or CCP1 is always
used, and `_channel_` is ignored. (It should be set to 1 anyway to allow
for future upgrades to more powerful microcontrollers.)

`_frequency_` sets the frequency of the PWM output. It is measured in KHz.
The maximum value allowed is 255 KHz. The minimum value varies depending
on the clock speed. 1 KHz is the minimum on chips 16 MHz or under and 2
Khz is the lowest possible on 20 MHz chips. In situations that do not
require a specific PWM frequency, the PWM frequency should equal
approximately 1 five-hundredth the clock speed of the microcontroller (ie 40 Khz on
a 20 MHz chip, 16 KHz on an 8 MHz chip). This gives the best duty cycle
resolution possible.

`_duty cycle_` specifies the desired duty cycle of the PWM signal, and
ranges from 0 to 255 where 255 is 100% duty cycle.

`timer` specifies the timer source. Timers 2, 4 and 6 are supported.

To stop the PWM signal use the `HPWMOff` method with the parameter of the channel.
