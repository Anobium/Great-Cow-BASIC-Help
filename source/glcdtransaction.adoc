o make the operation of the library seamless - the library supports GLCDTransaction.   GLCDTransaction automatically manages the methods to update the e-paper via the buffer, where the buffer can be small.   The process of transaction send GLCD commands to the e-paper display on a page and page basis.   Each page is the size of the buffer and for a large e-paper display the number of pages may be equivilent to the numbers of pixels high (height).

GLCDTransaction simplies the operation by ensure the buffer is setup correctly, handles the GLCD appropiately, handles the sending of the buffer and then close out the update to the display.

To use GLCDTransaction use the followng methods.

        GLCD_Open_PageTransaction
            ....
            glcd commands
            .....

        GLCD_Close_PageTransaction
It recommended to use GLCDTransactions at all times.  These methods remove the complexity of the e-paper update process.

When using GLCDTransaction you must use GLCD_Open_PageTransaction then a series of GLCD commands and then GLCD_Close_PageTransaction.

WHen using GLCDtransactions as the number of buffer pages may be must greater then 1, then, process of variables and calls to non-GLCD methods must be considered carefully. As the number of pages may be greater than one the process will increment variables and call non-GLCD methods the same number of times as the number of pages.  THerefore, design GLCDTransaction operations with this is mind.

Use of SRAM as the e-paper buffer

To improve memory usage the e-paper libraries support the use of SRAM.   SRAM can be used as an alternative to minimize the amount of allocation RAM.   Using SRAM does have a small performance impact but free up the critical resource of the microcontrollers RAM.   The use of SRAM within the e-paper library is transparent to the user.   To use SRAM as the e-paper buffer you will need to set-up the SRAM library.   See the SRAM library for more details on SRAM usage.   

When using SRAM for the e-paper buffer it is still remcommend to use GLCDTransaction as this ensure the SRAM buffer is correctly initialised.
