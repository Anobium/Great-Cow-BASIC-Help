==== IntOn

*Syntax:*
----
    IntOn
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on Microchip PIC and Atmel AVR microcontrollers with interrupt support. Will
be automatically removed on chips without interrupts.

*Explanation:*

`IntOn` is used to enable interrupts on the microcontroller after `IntOff`
has disabled them. It should be used at the end of code which is
timing-sensitive.

`IntOn` will be removed from the assembler if no interrupts are used.
