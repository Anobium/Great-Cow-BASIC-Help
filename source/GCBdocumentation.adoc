== Introduction

GCBasic documentation is maintained through http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] a fast text processor
 and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc content to HTML5, DocBook 5 (or 4.5) and other formats.
Asciidoctor is written in Ruby, packaged as a RubyGem and published to RubyGems.org.

Since http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] is written in Ruby it can run very easily under windows without 
the need to install a https://www.virtualbox.org/[linux virtual machine] or a
https://www.cygwin.com/[cygwin environment].

Derived from and mostly compatible with the original http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[asciidoc] language, 
asciidoctor can convert human readable text files created with a simple editor into all sorts of formats. 
It's software companion, asciidoctor-pdf, converts your files into pdf with a single command. 
Finally you can also generates Docbook 5 or 4.5 xml files and apply to them a large set of available stylesheets.

The main advantages of using asciidoctor to maintain GCBasic documentation are:

- A very simple language inserted into plain text files which remains fully readable
- Yet specifically designed to write documentation and especially software one
- Those text files can the be transformed into xml, html, pdf, chm very easily

== Installation of the environnement

The following steps are only required once and describe the production environment required for the
documentation administrator. A Windows environment is assumed. 

Contributors only require a Windows 
text editor and are then all set to edit the documentation following the tips provided in the second 
chapter of this documentation <<_creating_gcb_documentation,Creating GCB documentation>>.

=== Step 1: install a Windows text editor

The choice is yours, but you definitively do not want to use Windows original Notepad !
My favorite one in the Windows environment is https://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++].
Make sure UTF-8 encoding (without BOM) is default.

=== Step 2: install Ruby Installer for Windows

Asciidoctor being written in https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby] you need to 
http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/[install it].

Choose the latest (i.e. 2.2.2) version corresponding to your machine (32 or 64 bits).
By default Ruby will be installed either in `c:\ruby22` or `c:\ruby22-x64` directory depending 
on the version you selected.

Include the directory at the end of your `PATH` environment variable as described 
http://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/[here]. 

Insert `C:\Ruby22\bin` or `C:\Ruby22-x64\bin` using `";"` as a delimiter at the end of your current `PATH` string.

You can now check that `ruby` is present and running by typing:
----
ruby --version
----
That should display the installed Ruby version:
----
C:\>ruby --version
ruby 2.2.2p95 (2015-04-13 revision 50295) [x64-mingw32]
C:\>
----

=== Step 3: install Asciidoctor Ruby packages

You cannow install the asciidoc & asciidoc-pdf packages. The Ruby `gem` command makes it very easy !

- http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. From a Windows `cmd.exe` console type:
+
 gem install asciidoctor

- http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[Asciidoctor-pdf]. From a Windows `cmd.exe` console type:
+
----
gem --pre install asciidoctor-pdf
----
`asciidoctor-pdf` is still alpha (hence the `--pre` parameter ) but working already nicely. 
Dependant packages will be automatically installed.

- http://coderay.rubychan.de/[Coderay]. From a Windows `cmd.exe` console type:
+
 gem install coderay

Assuming all the required gems are properly installed, verify you can run asciidoctor and asciidoctor-pdf:
----
asciidoctor -v
asciidoctor-pdf -v
----
That should display the installed Asciidoctor and Asciidoctor-pdf versions:
----
C:\>asciidoctor -v
Asciidoctor 1.5.2 [http://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (ruby 2.2.2p95 (2015-04-13 revision 50295) [x64-mingw32]) (l
c:CP850 fs:Windows-1252 in:- ex:CP850)

C:\>asciidoctor-pdf -v
Asciidoctor PDF 1.5.0.alpha.8 using Asciidoctor 1.5.2 [http://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (ruby 2.2.2p95 (2015-04-13 revision 50295) [x64-mingw32]) (l
c:CP850 fs:Windows-1252 in:- ex:CP850)
----
If you see a result as above, youâ€™re ready to use Asciidoctor and Asciidoctor-pdf !

=== Step 4: install docbook-xsl-ns stylesheets

`asciidoctor` can easily generates Docbook 5.0 xml documents. For example, a simple command like:
----
asciidoctor -b docbook mysample.adoc
----
will automatically create a Docbook 5.0 `mysample.xml` file.

In order to process those `xml` generated files you need the 
http://www.docbook.org/docs/howto/#processing[DocBook XSL-NS stylesheets] from the docbook-xsl-ns
package. It contains the recommended XSLT 1.0 stylesheets to use for transforming namespaced (DocBook V5.0) documents.
Those stylesheets will then be processed - together with the input xml file - with an xslt processor. 
In our case `Saxon` (see step 7 below).

Unzip http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl-ns/1.78.1/docbook-xsl-ns-1.78.1.zip/download[this file]
and install it under `c:\docbook-xsl-ns`

Now you need to apply a patch in order to be able to use the `webhelp.xsl` and the `htmlhelp.xsl` stylesheets
on the xml files generated by `asciidoctor` in order to convert specific `asciidoctor` tags.

1. Edit `c:\docbook-xsl-ns\webhelp\xsl\webhelp-common.xsl` and insert a the top of it
(_i.e._ right before the `<xsl:param name="chunker.output.method">` line) the following 3 lines of code:
+
----
<xsl:template match="processing-instruction('asciidoc-br')"> 
  <br/> 
</xsl:template>
----
2. Edit `c:\docbook-xsl-ns\htmlhelp\xsl\htmlhelp.xsl` and insert a the top of it
the same 3 lines of code.

We also want our favorite Cow to appear on the GCB web site. Therefore replace the original  
`c:\docbook-xsl-ns\webhelp\template\common\images\logo.png` with link:common\images\logo.png[this one].

Finally replace the `build.properties` file in the `c:\docbook-xsl-ns\webhelp`
directory with the one provided  in the `..\GCBdoc\source\images` directory and
available link:images/build.properties[here].

=== Step 5: install Java

There is a strong probability that Java is already installed on your machine. To check it type:
----
java -version
----
That should display the running Java version.

If you have not installed Java yet, you can download the Java Run Time Environment corresponding to your
machine from the https://java.com/en/[Java Web site].

=== Step 6: install Apache Ant

http://ant.apache.org/[Apache Ant] is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive processes described in build
files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. 
The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications.

Download the latest binary ditribution (1.9.6 at the time of this writing) from
https://www.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/[here]. 

Unzip the file to a convenient location (e.g. `c:\ant`). 

Set the environment variable `PATH_ANT` to this directory.

Set `%PATH_ANT%\bin` to your `PATH` variable. Check it's there with `ECHO %PATH%`.

Goto any directory and make sure `ant` is running:
----
ant -version
----
The `ant` version should show up.

=== Step 7: install Saxon (6-5-x)

The http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/?source=navbar[Saxon] package is a collection of tools for 
processing XML documents.

You need to download the 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/saxon6/6.5.5/saxon6-5-5.zip/download[6.5.5 version].

Unzip the file to a convenient location (e.g. `C:\saxon6-5-5`).

=== Step 8: install the Microsoft HTML Help Workshop

Microsoft HTML Help Workshop (`hhw.exe`) is an executable program designed to help you create help systems
using source files based on Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). With HTML Help Workshop, 
you can create help systems for distribution with a software program or as stand-alone systems on a Web site.

This is a plain vanilla Windows program that you can download
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21138[here].

We are going to use this program trough `hhc.exe` the command line version of Windows `hhw.exe`.
We must therefore declare its directory in the 
`PATH` variable. On a 64 bit machine `PATH` do not like spaces in directory names. Unfortunately the program
is installed in `C:\Program Files (x86)\HTML Help Workshop\`...

Therefore one will have to add at the end of the `PATH` variable the original DOS directory name: +
`C:\Progra\~2\HTMLHE~1`

Make sure you can run `hhc` program by typing `hhc` from the console line. You should get:
----
C:\>hhc -h

Usage:   hhc <filename>
    where <filename> = an HTML Help project file
Example: hhc filename.hhp

== Creating GCB documentation

GCBasic documentation is splitted in small `sectioname.adoc` text files which are then merged in a `master.adoc`
one. 

The syntax used in GCB `master.adoc` file is as follows:
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"] 
....
= GCBasic documentation
GCB team                                    (1)
:toc: 								
:toclevels: 4                               (2)						
:imagesdir: ./images                        (3)

include::introducinggcbasic.adoc[]          (4)

include::gettingstartedwithgcbasic.adoc[]   (4)

include::changes.adoc[]                     (4)

...

Comments:
(1) Author's name
(2) Maximum level of documentation depth
(3) Directory where the images are located relative to the current one
(4) Inclusion of a file
....
The syntax to be used in a `sectioname.adoc` file is:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"] 
....

== Generating GCB documentation files

=== Introduction

The GCB documentation directory is organized as follow:
----
GCBdoc
   |------ source
   |        |-------images
   |
   |------ output
            |------- chm
            |------- html
            |------- html5
            |------- pdf
            |------- web
            |------- xml
----	
The `GCBdoc` directory contains two subdirs: `source` and `output`.

The `source` subdir contains all the `*.adoc` files including `master.adoc`. It also
contains:

1. an `images` subdir which includes all the image files used in the documentation.
2. a `gcbdoc.bat` file (see appendix) used to generate all sorts of output format in the
`GCBdoc\output` subdirs. The syntax is as follows:
+
[subs="quotes"] 
----
gcbdoc _filename_ _conversion_type_
----
`_filename_` is the prefix of the `_filename.adoc_` file that you want to convert. +
`_conversion_type_` is the desired type of conversion among `html`, `pdf`, `xml`, `chm`, `html5`, `web` or `all`.

The `output` subdir is where we are going to store our converted documentation files.

=== HTML output

From your `..\GCBdoc\source` subdir type:
----
gcbdoc filename html
----
This will generate the `filename.html` file in the  `...\GCBdoc\ouput\html\` directory.

=== PDF output

From your `..\GCBdoc\source` subdir type:
----
gcbdoc filename pdf
----
This will generate the `filename.pdf` file in the  `...\GCBdoc\ouput\pdf\` directory.

=== XML output

From your `..\GCBdoc\source` subdir type:
----
gcbdoc filename xml
----
This will generate the `filename.xml` file in the  `...\GCBdoc\ouput\xml\` directory.

=== CHM (Microsoft Help File) output

From your `..\GCBdoc\source` subdir type:
----
gcbdoc filename chm
----
This will create a Microsoft `filename.chm` help file in the `..\GCBdoc\output\chm` directory. 

=== Htmlhelp output

The most "basic" web based documentation can be generated with the `htmlhelp.xsl` stylesheet.

From the `...\GCBdoc\source` subdir type:
----
gcbdoc filename html5
----
This will generate the `filename.html` file in the  `...\GCBdoc\ouput\html5\` directory.

=== Webhelp output

We are now going to use the `webhelp.xsl` stylesheet in order to generate our web site. Among other things
the site will include complete navigation tools and also a search facility.

From the `...\GCBdoc\source` subdir type:
----
gcbdoc filename web
----
Your full Webhelp based documentation is now ready in 
`..\GCBdoc\output\web\filename` directory !

=== Automate the whole process !

You can guess it ! It's as simple as issuing:
[subs="quotes"] 
----
gcbdoc _filename_ _conversion_type_
----
`_filename_` is the prefix of the `_filename.adoc_` file that you want to convert.

`_conversion_type_` is the desired type of conversion among `html`, `pdf`, `xml`, `chm`, `html5`, `web` or `all`.

=== Working on your documentation

When editing a new documentation chapter, the `filename.adoc` file will be tested with:
----
gcbdoc filename html
----
And the result checked with your browser at address `..\GCBdoc\output\html\filename.html`

Once you are happy with the result, the documentation can be translated in the whole different formats
with a simple command:
----
gcbdoc filename all
----
Happy documentation writing !

ifdef::backend-pdf[<<<]
== Appendix

The `gcbdoc.bat` batch file is located in the `...\GCBdoc\source` directory. 
You need to check and adapt the environnement variables (look for the SET commands)
and the directories given as parameters if you have redefined installation directories.
