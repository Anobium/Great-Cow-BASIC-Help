==== LCD Overview

*Introduction:*

The LCD routines in this section allow Great Cow BASIC programs to control an
alphanumeric Liquid Crystal Displays based on the *HD44780* IC. This
covers most 16 x 1, 16 x 2, 20 x 4 and 40 x 4 LCD displays.

These methods allow the displays to be connected to the microcontroller
in many different ways:

|*Required Connections*
|0
|No configuration is required directly by this method. The LCD routines
*must* be provided with other subroutines which will handle the
communication. This is useful for communicating with LCDs connected
through RS232 or I2C.
 +
This is an advanced method of driving an LCD.
|1
|Uses a combined data and clock line. This mode is used when the LCD is connected through a
shift register 74HC595, as detailed at http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/library/DIAGRAMS/1-Wire%20LCD/[*here*].
 +
This method of driving an LCD requires an additional integrated circuit and other passive components.
This is not recommended for the beginner.
|2
|Uses separated Data and Clock lines. This mode is used when the LCD is connected
through a 74LS174 shift register IC, as detailed at
http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/library/DIAGRAMS/2-Wire%20LCD/[*here*]
 +
This method of driving an LCD requires additional integrated circuits
and other passive components. This is not recommended for the beginner.
|4
|`R/W`, `RS`, `Enable` and the highest 4 data lines (`DB4` through `DB7`) are
connected to the microcontroller. The use of the R/W line is optional.
 +
This a common method to connect a microcontroller to an LCD. This
requires 7(6) data ports on the microcontroller.
|8
|`R/W`, `RS`, `Enable` and all 8 data lines. The data lines must all be
connected to the same I/O port, in sequential order. For example, `DB0` to
`PORTB.0`, `DB1` to `PORTB.1` and so on, with`DB7` going to `PORTB.7`.
 +
This is a common method to connect a microcontroller to a LCD. This
requires 11(10) data ports on the microcontroller.
|10
|The LCD is controlled via I2C. A type 10 LCD 12C adapter. Set `LCD_10` to
`10` for the YwRobot LCD1602 IIC V1 or the Sainsmart LCD_PIC I2C adapter
 +
This is a common method and requires two data ports on the microcontroller.
|12
|The LCD is controlled via I2C. A type 12 LCD 12C adapter. Set `LCD_10` to
`12`for the Ywmjkdz I2C adapter with a potentiometer (variable resistance) bent over top of chip.
 +
This is a common method and requires two data ports on the microcontroller.
