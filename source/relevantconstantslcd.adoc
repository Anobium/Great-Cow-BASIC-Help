==== LCD Overview

*Introduction:*

The LCD routines in this section allow Great Cow BASIC programs to control an
alphanumeric Liquid Crystal Displays based on the *HD44780* IC. This
covers most 16 x 1, 16 x 2, 20 x 4 and 40 x 4 LCD displays.

The Great Cow BASIC methods allow the displays to be connected to the microcontroller

*Connection Modes:*

The table below shows the connection modes.  These modes support the connection to the LCD using differting methods.

[cols="^1,1", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Connection Mode
|Required Connections
|0
|No configuration is required directly by this method. The LCD routines
*must* be provided with other subroutines which will handle the
communication. This is useful for communicating with LCDs connected
through RS232 or I2C.
 +
This is an advanced method of driving an LCD.
|1
|Uses a combined data and clock line. This mode is used when the LCD is connected through a
shift register 74HC595, as detailed at http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/library/DIAGRAMS/1-Wire%20LCD/[*here*].
 +
This method of driving an LCD requires an additional integrated circuit and other passive components.
This is not recommended for the beginner.
|2
|Uses separated Data and Clock lines. This mode is used when the LCD is connected
through a 74LS174 shift register IC, as detailed at
http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/library/DIAGRAMS/2-Wire%20LCD/[*here*]
 +
This method of driving an LCD requires additional integrated circuits
and other passive components. This is not recommended for the beginner.
|3
|`DB`, `CB`, `EB` are connected to the microcontroller as the Data, Clock and Enable Bits.
 +
This a common method to connect a microcontroller to an LCD. This
requires 3 data ports on the microcontroller.
|4
|`R/W`, `RS`, `Enable` and the highest 4 data lines (`DB4` through `DB7`) are
connected to the microcontroller. The use of the R/W line is optional.
 +
This a common method to connect a microcontroller to an LCD. This
requires 7(6) data ports on the microcontroller.
|8
|`R/W`, `RS`, `Enable` and all 8 data lines. The data lines must all be
connected to the same I/O port, in sequential order. For example, `DB0` to
`PORTB.0`, `DB1` to `PORTB.1` and so on, with`DB7` going to `PORTB.7`.
 +
This is a common method to connect a microcontroller to a LCD. This
requires 11(10) data ports on the microcontroller.
|10
|The LCD is controlled via I2C. A type 10 LCD 12C adapter. Set `LCD_10` to
`10` for the YwRobot LCD1602 IIC V1 or the Sainsmart LCD_PIC I2C adapter
 +
This is a common method and requires two data ports on the microcontroller.
|12
|The LCD is controlled via I2C. A type 12 LCD 12C adapter. Set `LCD_10` to
`12`for the Ywmjkdz I2C adapter with a potentiometer (variable resistance) bent over top of chip.
 +
This is a common method and requires two data ports on the microcontroller.

.Communication Performance
[NOTE]
===============================

There may be a need to change the communication performance for a specific LCD as some LCD's are slower to operate.  Great Cow BASIC supports change the communications speed.

To change the performance (communications speed) of the LCD use `#DEFINE LCD_SPEED`.  This method allows the timing to be optimised.

_Example_
----
 #DEFINE LCD_SPEED  FAST
----


[cols=2, options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Define
|Performace Characteristics

|`LCD_SPEED`
|`FAST`     - The speed is approximately 20,000 CPS. +
`MEDIUM`   - The speed is approximately 15,000 CPS. +
`SLOW`     - The speed is approximately 10,000 CPS. +
`OPTIMAL`  - The speed is approximately 30,000 CPS. +
|===

If `LCD_SPEED` is not defined, the speed defaults to `SLOW`

.Using LCD_Speed OPTIMAL
[NOTE]
===============================

`OPTIMAL` disables fixed delays and allows the LCD operate as fast as it can.&#160;&#160;In this mode, The the busy flag is polled before each byte is sent to the HD44780 controller. &#160;&#160;This not only optimizes speed, but also assures that data is not sent to the diplay controler until it is ready to receive the data.

With most displays this equates to a speed of about 30,000 characters per second.&#160;&#160;For comparision about 10 times faster than I2C using a PC8574 Expander (See LCD_IO 10 or  See LCD_IO 112)

`OPTIMAL` is only supported in LCD_IO 4,8 and only when LCD_NO_RW is not defined  (RW Mode).&#160;&#160;When `#DEFINE LCD_NO_RW` is defined, reading data from the HD44780 is not possible since this disables Read Mode on the controller.&#160;&#160;In this case busy flag checking is not available and the GET subroutine is not avaiable.

In order to enable busy flag checking, and, therefore to use the `GET` command the following criteria must be true.

1. LCD I/O Mode must be either 4-wire or 8-wire
2. `#DEFINE LCD_NO_RW` is not defined
3. An I\O pin is connected between the microcontroller and the RW connection on the LCD Display
4. `'DEFINE LCD_RW  port.pin` is defined in the Great Cow BASIC source code


Example:
----
  #DEFINE LCD_IO 4
  #DEFINE LCD_SPEED OPTIMAL

  #DEFINE LCD_DB7 PORTB.5
  #DEFINE LCD_DB6 PORTB.4
  #DEFINE LCD_DB7 PORTB.3
  #DEFINE LCD_DB6 PORTB.2

  #DEFINE LCD_RW PORTA.3    'Must be defined for RW Mode
  #DEFINE LCD_RS PORTA,2
  #DEFINE LCD_ENABLE PORTA.1

.Changing the LCD Width
[NOTE]
===============================
To change the LCD width characteristics use `#define LCD_WIDTH`
