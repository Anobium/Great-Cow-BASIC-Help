===== LCD_IO 12

*Using connection mode 12:*

The LCD is controlled via I2C.
A type 12 is the Ywmjkdz I2C adapter with potentiometer  variable resistor) bent over top of chip.
To use mode 12 you must define the I2C ports as normal in your GCB code.
Then, define the LCD type, set the I2C_address of the LCD adapter and the LCD speed, if required.


*Relevant Constants:*

These constants are used to control settings for the Liquid Crystal
Display routines included with Great Cow BASIC. To set them, place a line in the
main program file that uses `#define` to assign a value to the particular
constant.

When using 2-bit mode only three constants must be set - all others can
be ignored.
