*Explanation:*

The `Trim` function will trim the 7-bit ASCII space character (value 32) from text.

`Trim` removes all spaces from text except for single spaces between words. Use `Trim` on text that you have received from another source that may have irregular spacing at the left or right hand ends of the string.
