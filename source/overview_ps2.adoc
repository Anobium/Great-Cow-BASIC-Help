==== PS/2 Overview

*PS2 Overview*

These routines make it easier to communicate with a PS/2 device,
particularly an external keyboard.

*Relevant Constants*

These constants affect the operation of the PS/2 routines:

|===
|*Constant Name*
|*Controls*
|*Default Value*
|`PS2Data`
|Pin connected to PS/2 data line
|Must be specified
|`PS2Clock`
|Pin connected to PS/2 clock line.
|Must be specified
|`PS2_DELAY`
|This constant can be set to a delay, such as 10 ms. If set, a delay will
be added at the end of every byte sent or received.
|Not set

*Connections between the Keyboard and the Microcontroller*
The following diagram show a typical connection between the keyboard and the microcontroller.  The value of R1 and R2 is typically 4.7k for a 5v system.
