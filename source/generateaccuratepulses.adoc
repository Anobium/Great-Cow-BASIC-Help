=== Generate Accurate Pulses

*Explanation:*

The `PulseOut` Command is a reliable method for generating pulses if accuracy is not critical,
the `PulseOut` command uses a calculation of the clock to speed for the timing .

If you need better accuracy and resolution then an alternative approach is required.

To generate pulses in the 100 us to 2500 us range with an accuracy of +- 1us over this range is practical using the approach shown in this example.

This example code works on a midrange PIC16F690 operating at 8Mhz.
However, it should work on any Microchip PIC microcontroller, but may need some minor modifications.

*Usage:*
----
    Pulse_Out_us ( word_value )
----

*How It Works:*

`Timer1` is loaded with a preset value based upon the variable passed to the sub routine.
The timer (`Timer1`) is started and the pulse pin (the output pin) is set high.
When `Timer1` overflows the Timer1 interrupt flag bit (`TMR1IF`) is set.  This causes the program to
exit a polling loop and set the pulse Pin off. Then, `Timer1` is stopped and `TMRIF` flag is cleared and the sub routine exits.

This method supports delays between 5 us and 65535 us and uses Timer1.

*Test Results:*

These tests were completed using a Saleae Logic Analyzer.
