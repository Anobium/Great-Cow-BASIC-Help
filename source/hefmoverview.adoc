==== HEFM Overview

*Introduction:*

Some enhanced mid-range Microchip PIC devices support High-Endurance Flash (HEF) memory. These devices lack the data EEPROM found on other devices.&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead, they implement an equivalent amount of special flash memory, called HEF memory, that can provide an endurance comparable to that of a traditional data EEPROM.&#160;&#160;&#160;
HEF memory can be erased and written 100,000 times.&#160;&#160;&#160;
HEF memory appears in the regular program memory space and can be used for any purpose, like regular flash program memory.&#160;&#160;&#160;

As with all flash memory, data must be erased before it can be written and writing this memory will stall the device.&#160;&#160;&#160;
Methods to read, write and erase the HEF memory are included in Great Cow BASIC and they are described in this introduction.&#160;&#160;&#160;Also see Microchip application note AN1673, Using the PIC16F1XXX High-Endurance Flash (HEF) Block.

The `hefsaf.h` library supports HEF operations for Great Cow BASIC.

Note:  By default, Great Cow BASIC will use HEF memory for regular executable code unless it is told otherwise.&#160;&#160;&#160;
If you wish to store data here, you should reserve the HEF memory by using the compiler option, as shown below to reserve 128 words of HEF memory:

----
    #option ReserveHighProg 128
----
HEF memory is a block of memory locations found at the top of the Flash program memory.&#160;&#160;&#160;
Each memory location can be used to hold one 8-bit byte variable.&#160;&#160;&#160;
With Enhanced Midrange Devices (PIC 16F) a Program Memory "word" is only 14-bits wide.&#160;&#160;&#160;
Therefore, it requires one Program Memory "word" to hold one 8-bit byte variable, and two Program Memory "words" to hold one 16-bit word variable.&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only the lower 8-bits of each 14-bit Program Memory word are used by HEF.

The main difference between HEF memory and EEPROM is that EEPROM allows byte-by-byte erase whereas the HEF memory does not.&#160;&#160;&#160;
With HEF memory, data must be erased before a write and the erase can only be performed in blocks of memory.&#160;&#160;&#160;
The blocks, also called rows, are a fixed size associated with the specific device.&#160;&#160;&#160;
{empty} +
{empty} +
Great Cow BASIC handles the erase operation automatically.&#160;&#160;&#160;
When a write operation is used by a user the Great Cow BASIC library reads to a cache, updates the cache, erase the block and finally write the caches.&#160;&#160;&#160;
The complexity of using HEF memory is reduced with the automatically handling of these operations.&#160;&#160;&#160;

The library also defines a set constants that are specific to the device.&#160;&#160;&#160;
These may be useful in the user program.&#160;&#160;&#160;
These constants are used by the library.&#160;&#160;&#160;
A user may use these public constants.

*Warning*

Whenever you update the hex file of your Microchip PIC micro-controller with your programmer you MAY erase the data that are stored in HEF memory.&#160;&#160;&#160;
If you want to avoid that you will have to flash your Microchip PIC micro-controller with software that allows memory exclusion when flashing.&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is the case with Microchip PIC MPLAB IPE (Go to `Advanced Mode/Enter password/Select Memory/Tick “Preserve Flash on Program”/
Enter Start and End address` of your HEFM).&#160;&#160;&#160;Or, simply use the PICkitPlus suite of software to preserve HEF memory during programming.
