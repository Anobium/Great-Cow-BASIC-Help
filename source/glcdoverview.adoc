==== GLCD Overview

The GLCD commands are used to control a Graphical Liquid Crystal Display (GLCD)
based on the a number of GLCD chipsets. These are often 128x64 pixel displays but the size can vary.
GLCD devices draw graphical elements by enabling or disabling pixels.

A GLCD is an upgrade from the
popular 16x2 LCDs (see <<_lcd_overview,Liquid Crystal
Display Overview>> ) but the GLCD allows full graphical control of the
display.


Typical displays are

- Color or mono displays
- Low power white LED, OLED with or without back-light
- e-Paper with low power consumption
- Driven by on-board interface chipsets amd/or interface controllers
- The GLCDs are very common and well documented
- Small to large view areas
- Typically requires from 3-pin to 36-pin header connections and 10K contrast pot
- Typically have back-lit pixels
- Require memory in the microcontroller to support graphial operations or can be used in text and picture mode


Great Cow BASIC makes this type of device easier to control with the
commands for the GLCD.

*Microcontroller Requirements:*
Specific GLCDs require different configurations of a microcontroller.  Parameters include

- Communications protocol: These incldue 8 wire bus, I2C, SPI etc
- Operating votlage: These are typically 3.3v or 5.v
- Memory required: For full GLCD capabilites you will require 1k or more, for text only and JPG mode low memory devices are supported

Review your choice of microcontroller and GLCD carefully before commencing your project.
