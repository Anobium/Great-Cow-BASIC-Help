=== Lookup Tables

*About Lookup Tables*

A lookup table is a list of values that are stored in the memory of the microcontroller, which then can be accessed using the `ReadTable` command.

The advantage of lookup tables is that they are memory efficient,
compared to an equivalent set of alternative command statements.

Data tables are defined as follows:

. a single value on each line
. byte, word, longs and integer values are valid.&#160;&#160;
. Strings must be expressed as ASCII byte value(s)
. multiple elements on a single line separated by commas
. constants and calculations within the single line data table entries are permitted
. an external data source file
. decimal values are NOT supported

*Defining Tables*


_Single data values_

A single value on each line with in the table.&#160;&#160;The example table, shown below, has the data on different line in within the table.
----

    Table TestDataSource
        12
        24
        36
        48
        60
        72
    End Table

    Dim TableCounter, Invalue as byte

    CLS
    For TableCounter = 1 to 6
      ReadTable  TestDataSource, TableCounter, Invalue
      Print InValue
      Print ","
    Next
----

_Multiple data values of the same line_

Multiple elements on a single line separated by commas.&#160;&#160;The example table, shown below, has the data separated by `,` and on different line in within the table.
----
    Table TestDataSource
        12,  24, 36
        48,  60, 72
    End Table

    Dim TableCounter, Invalue as byte

    CLS
    For TableCounter = 1 to 6
      ReadTable  TestDataSource, TableCounter, Invalue
      Print InValue
      Print ","
    Next
----

_Data values as constants, and, with data transformation_

Constants and calculations within the single line.  &#160;&#160;The example table, shown below, uses a defined constant to multiple the data with the table.
----
#define calculation_constant 2

    Table TestDataSource
      1 * calculation_constant
      2 * calculation_constant
      3 * calculation_constant
      8 * calculation_constant
      4 * calculation_constant
      5 * calculation_constant
    End Table

    Dim TableCounter, Invalue as byte

    CLS
    For TableCounter = 1 to 6
      ReadTable  TestDataSource, TableCounter, Invalue
      Print InValue
      Print ","
    Next
----
&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;

_Data values as Strings_

Strings can be defined.&#160;&#160;Strings are delimited by double quotes. &#160;&#160; The following examples show the methods.

Any ASCII characters between any two "    " (double quotes) will be converted to table data.&#160;&#160; Also see ASCII escape codes.

A source string can be one string per line or comma separated strings, therefore, on the same line.

Simple Example 1.

----
    Table Test_1
     "ABCDEFGHIJ"
    End Table
----

Simple Example 2.

----
    '
    Table  MnuTxt_1  'Home disp
       "  Display_1    Display_2    Display_3  "
    End Table

    Table MnuTxt_2   'Main Menu
     "1: Display"       ' Main1
     "2: System Setup"  ' Main2
     "3: Config 1"      ' Main3
     "4: Config 2"      ' Main4
     "5: Data Log"      ' Main5
     "6: Diagnostic"    ' Main6
     "7: Help+"         ' Main7
    End Table
----

The following 2 table lines produce the same table data.

----
    "String1","String2", "String3"
    "String1String2String3"
----

And, the following 3 table lines produce the same table data.

----
    "String1"
    "String2"
    "String3"
----

_ASCII Escape code_



Accepted escape strings are shown in the table below.

[cols=2, options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Escape sequence | Meaning
|\a |beep
|\b |backspace
|\f |formfeed
|\l or \n |newline
|\r |carriage return
|\t |tab
|\0 |Nul value, equates to ASCII 0. Same as \&000
|\&nnn  |ascii char in decimal
|\\ |backslash
|\" |double quote
|\' |single quote
|===


*Using Lookup Tables*

First, the table must be created. The code to create a lookup table is
simple - a line that has `Table` and then the name of the table, a list
of numbers (up to 10,000 elements), and then `End Table`.

For tables with more than 255 elements it is mandated to used a WORD variable to read the size of the table. See below for an example.

Once the table is created, the `ReadTable` command is used to read data
from it. The `ReadTable` command requires the name of the table it is to
read, the location of the item to retrieve, and a variable to store the
retrieved number in.

Lookup tables can store byte, word, longs and integer values.&#160;&#160;
Great Cow BASIC will try automatically detect the type of the table depending on the values in it.&#160;&#160;
Great Cow BASIC can be explicitly instructed to cast the table to a variable type, as follows:
----
    Table TestDataSource as [Byte | Word | Integer | Long ]
        12
        24
        36
        48
        60
        72
    End Table
----

_Addresssing the Table Data_


Item 0 of a lookup table stores the size of the table.
If the `ReadTable` command attempts to read beyond the end (number of data items) of the table, the value 0 will be returned.
For tables with more than 255 elements it is *mandatory* to use a WORD variable to read the size of the table. See example below.

----
    dim lengthoftable as word

    readtable TestDataSource , 0, lengthoftable
    print lengthoftable  ; will print the size as a word

    table TestDataSource
    'a table with more than 255 elements
    ... 'item 1
    ...
    ...
    ...  'item 1027
    end table
----

_Importing External Text File for table conversion_

An external file can be used as the table data source.&#160;&#160;
The file will be read into the specified table name from the external file.&#160;&#160;
The source file will be treated as a byte value file.

An example file is shown below:

image::lookuptablesb1.PNG[graphic,align="center"]

The following program will import the external data file.
----
    #chip 16f877a

    Table TestDataSource from "sourcefile.raw"

    for nn = 1 to 10
      ReadTable TestDataSource, nn, inc
      Print inc
    next
----
And the program will out the following:

image::lookuptablesb2.PNG[graphic,align="center"]


{empty} +
{empty} +



_Advanced use of Lookup Tables - using EEPROM for Table data storage_

You can use the `Table` statement to store the data table in EEPROM. If
the compiler is told to store a data table in "Data" memory, it will
store it in the EEPROM.

*NOTE*
The limitation of of using EPPROM tables is that you can only
store BYTEs. You cannot store WORD values in the EEPROM tables.

Example code:
----
    #chip 16F628

    'Read table item
    'Must use ReadTable and a variable for the index, or the table won't be
    downloaded to EEPROM

    TableLoc = 2
    ReadTable TestDataSource, TableLoc, SomeVar

    'Write to table , this is not required
    EPWrite 1, 45

    'Table of values to write to EEPROM
    'EEPROM location 0 will store length of table
    'Subsequent locations will each store a value

    Table TestDataSource Store Data
        12
        24
        36
        48
        60
        72
    End Table
----
