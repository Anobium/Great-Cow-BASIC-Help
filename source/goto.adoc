==== Goto

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]

----
    Goto _label_
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

The `Goto` command will make the microcontroller jump to the line specified, and
continue running the program from there. The `Goto` command is mainly
useful for exiting out of loops - if you need to create an infinite
loop, use the `Do` command instead.

Be careful how you use `Goto`. If used too much, it can make programs very
hard to read.

To define a label, put the name of the label alone on a line, with just
a colon (:) after it.

*Example:*

----
    'This program will flash the light until the button is pressed
    'off. Notice the label named SWITCH_OFF.

    #chip 16F628A, 4 'Change this line to suit your circuit

    #define BUTTON PORTB.0
    #define LIGHT PORTB.1
    Dir BUTTON In
    Dir LIGHT Out

    Do
    	PulseOut LIGHT, 500 ms
    	If BUTTON = 1 Then Goto SWITCH_OFF
    	Wait 500 ms
    	If BUTTON = 1 Then Goto SWITCH_OFF
    Loop

    SWITCH_OFF:
    Set LIGHT Off
    'Chip will enter low power mode when program ends
