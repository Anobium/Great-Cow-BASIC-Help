==== Power

*Syntax*:
[subs="quotes"]
----
    power( base, exponent )
----
*Explanation:*

This function raises a base to an exponent, i.e, `power(base,exponent)`. Calculation powers will become large, in terms of long numbers, you must ensure the program manage numbers remain within range of the defined variables.

The `base` and `exponent` are Byte sized numbers in this method. +
The returned result is a Long. +
Non-negative numbers are assumed throughout.

*Note:*
0 raised to 0 is meaningless and should be avoided, but, any other non-zero base raised to 0 is handled correctly.
