=== #ifndef

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    #ifndef __Constant__ | __Constant Value__ | Var(__VariableName__)
      ...
    #endif
----
*Explanation:*

The `#ifndef` directive is used to selectively enable sections of code. It is the opposite of the `#ifdef` directive - it will delete code in cases where `#ifdef` would leave it, and will leave code where `#ifdef` would delete it.

*See* the <<__ifdef,#ifdef>> article for more information.
