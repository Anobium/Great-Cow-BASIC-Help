==== Gosub

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]

----
    Gosub _label_
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

The `Gosub` command is used to jump to a label as a subroutine, in a
similar way to `Goto`. The difference is that `Return` can then be used to
return to the line of code after the `Goto`.

*NOTE*

`Gosub` should NOT be used if it can be avoided. It is not
required to call a subroutine that has been defined using
<<_subroutines,Sub>>, just write the name of the subroutine.

*Example:*

----
    'This program will flash an LED on portb bit 0 and play a beep on
    'porta bit 4. until the microcontroller is turned off.

    #chip 16F628A, 4 'Change this to suit your circuit

    #define SOUNDOUT PORTA.4
    #define LIGHT PORTB.0
    Dir LIGHT Out

    Do
    	'Flash Light
    	PulseOut LIGHT, 1 s
    	Wait 1 s
    	'Beep
    	Gosub PlayBeep
    Loop

    PlayBeep:
    Tone 200, 10
    Tone 100, 10
    Return
