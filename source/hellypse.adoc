==== Hyperbole

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    Hyperbole (x,  y,  a_axis,  b_axis,  type, ModeStop, optional LineColour=GLCDForeground)
----

*Explanation:*

Draws on a GLCD an hyperbole with equation (x^2)/(a^2)-(y^2)/(b^2)=1, centered at  pixel positions (x, y)  with axis a and b.

The hyperbole can be aligned either along the x axis or along the y axis.

Both cases a_axis>=b:axis and a_axis<b_axis are accepted.

The hyperbole is an unbounded curve made by four branches


Drawing hyperbole on the screen can be stopped by following two different criteria:
  -  a branch has reached a border of the display
  -  all branches have reached the display border

For an hyperbole centered on the display these criteria are equivalent.

*Input parameters:*

[cols=2, options="header,autowidth"]

|*Parameter*
|*Controls*

|`x`
|X coordinates  of hyperbole center (in pixel positions)

|`y`
|Y coordinates  of hyperbole center (in pixel positions)


The x or y coordinates are Word value.

|`a_axis`
|The a axis of the hyperbole

|`b_axis`
|The b axis of the hyperbole


|`type`
|type=1 the hyperbole is aligned along x axis
{empty} +
type=2 the hyperbole is aligned along y axis

|`modestop`
|modestop=1 drawing stops when a display border is encountered by a hyperbole branch.
{empty} +
modestop=2 drawing stops when all the reachable display borders are encountered by all the hyperbole branches

|`LineColour`
|Color of the hyperbole
