|*Method*
|*Controls*

|Tone
|Generate a specified tone for a specified duration in terms of a frequency of a specified Mhz and units of 10ms

|ShortTone
|Generate a specified tone for a specified duration in terms of a frequency of a 10Mhz and units of 1ms

|Play
|Play a tune string.  The format of the string is the QBASIC play command.

|PlayRTTTL
|Play a tune string.  The format of the string is the Nokia cell phone RTTTL format.

*Relevant Constants:*

These constants are used to control settings for the tone generation routines. To set them, place a line in the main program file that uses `#define` to assign a value to the particular constant.

|`SoundOut`
|The output pin to produce sound on

*_Note:_* If an exact frequency is required, or a smaller program is needed, these routines should not be used. Instead, you should use code like this:
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
    Repeat _count_
    PulseOut SoundOut, _period_ us
    Wait _period_ us
    End Repeat
----

Set `_count_` and `_period_` to the appropriate values as follows:

`_period_` to 1000000 / desired frequency / 2 +
`_count_` to desired duration / _period_.
