==== GLCDTimeDelay

*Syntax:*
----
    GLCDTime
----
*Explanation:*

This will call the delay routine that delays data transmissions. By
default this is set to `20`, which equate to `20 us`. `GLCDTimeDelay` default
of `20us` is for 32Mhz support. The can be reduced for slower chip speeds
by change the constant `ST7920WriteDelay`.

*Example usage:*
----
    GLCDTime                       'call the delay routine
    #define ST7920WriteDelay 1     'set the delay to 1 us
