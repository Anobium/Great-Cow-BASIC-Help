=== Configuration

*About Configuration*

_(Note: This section does not apply to Atmel AVR microcontrollers. Atmel AVR microcontrollers
do have a similar configuration settings, but they are controlled
through "Configuration Fuses". Great Cow BASIC cannot set these -
you MUST use the programmer software.)_

Every Microchip PIC has a CONFIG word. This is an area of memory on the chip
that stores settings which govern the operation of the chip.

The following asects of the chip are governed by the CONFIG word:

- Oscillator selection - will the chip run from an internal oscillator,
or is an external one attached?
- Automatic resets - should the chip reset if the power drops too low?
If it detects it is running the same piece of code over and over?
- Code protection - what areas of memory must be kept hidden once
written to?
- Pin usage - which pins are available for programming, resetting the
chip, or emitting PWM signals?

The exact configuration settings vary amongst chips. To find out a list
of valid settings, please consult the datasheet for the microcontrollers that
you wish to use.

This can all be rather confusing - hence, Great Cow BASIC will automatically set
some config settings, unless told otherwise:

* *Low Voltage Programming (LVP) is turned off.* This enables the PGM
pin (usually B3 or B4) to be used as a normal I/O pin.
* *Watchdog Timer (WDT) is turned off.* The WDT resets the chip if it
runs the same piece of code over and over - this can cause trouble with
some of the longer delay routines in Great Cow BASIC.
* *Master Clear (MCLR) is disabled where possible.* On many newer chips
this allows the MCLR pin (often PORTA.5) to be used as a standard input
port. It also removes the need for a pull-up resistor on the MCLR pin.
* *An oscillator mode will be selected, based on the following rules:*
** If the microcontroller has an internal oscillator, and the internal oscillator is
capable of generating the speed specified in the #chip line, then the
internal oscillator will be used.
** If the clock speed is over 4 Mhz, the external HS oscillator is
selected
** If the clock speed is 4 MHz or less, then the external XT oscillator
mode is selected.

Note that these settings can easily be individually overridden whenever
needed. For example, if the Watchdog Timer is needed, adding the line
----
    #config WDT = ON
----
This will enable the watchdog timer, without affecting any other
configuration settings.

*Using Configuration*

Once the necessary CONFIG options have been determined, adding them to
the program is easy. On a new line type "#config" and then list the
desired options separated by commas, such as in this line:
----
    #config OSC = RC, BODEN = OFF
----
Great Cow BASIC also supports this format on 10/12/16 series chips:
----
    #config INTOSC_OSC_NOCLKOUT, BODEN_OFF
----
However, for upwards compatibility with 18F chips, you should use the = style config settings.

It is possible to have several #config lines in a program - for
instance, one in the main program, and one in each of several #include
files. However, care must then be taken to ensure that the settings in
one file do not conflict with those in another.
