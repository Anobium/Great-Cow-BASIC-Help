12F5xx, 16F5xx chips)

*Explanation:*

Should only be used when I2C routines are operating in Master mode, this
command will look for a specific I2C device on the I2C bus.

This sets a global variable `I2CAckPollState` that can be inspected in
your calling routine.

*Example:*
----
	 ...
	' ACK polling removes the need to for the 24xxxxx device to have a 5ms write time
	I2CACKPOLL( eeprom_device )
	' You check the exit state, use I2CAckPollState to check the state of
	' the acknowledge from the target device
