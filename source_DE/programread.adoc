==== ProgramRead

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]

----
    ProgramRead (_location, store_)
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all Microchip PIC microcontrollers with self write capability. Not available on
Atmel AVR at present.

*Explanation:*

`ProgramRead` reads information from the program memory on chips that
support this feature. `_location_` and `_store_` are both word variables,
meaning that they can store values over 255.

The largest value possible for `_location_` depends on the amount of
program memory on the Microchip PIC microcontroller, which is given on the datasheet. `_store_` is
14 bits wide, and thus can store values up to `16383`.

This is an advanced command which should only be used by advanced
developers.
