*Explanation:*

The `Log10` command will return the base-10 logarithm, to 2 decimal places.

The values returned are fixed-point numbers, with two decimal places assumed on the right. or if you prefer, think of the values as being scaled up by 100.

*Example:*
----
    dim log_value as word
    log_value = log10 ( 10 )      'return 230 equate to 2.30
