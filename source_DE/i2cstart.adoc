==== I2CStart

*Syntax:*
----
    I2CStart
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers except 12 bit instruction Microchip PIC microcontrollers (10F,
12F5xx, 16F5xx chips)

*Explanation:*

If the I2C routines are operating in Master mode, this command will send
a start condition. If routines are in Slave mode, it will pause the
program until a start condition is sent by the master. It should be
placed at the start of every I2C transmission.

If interrupt handling is enabled, this command will disable it.

*Example:*

Please see <<_i2csend,I2CSend>> and <<_i2creceive,I2CReceive>>
for an example.
