=== Serial/RS232 Buffer Ring

// Edit EvanV 01092016 to show buffer element 0 can be part of the buffer.

*Explanation:*

This program demonstrates how to create a serial input buffer ring.

This program program uses an interrupt event to capture the incoming byte value and place in the buffer ring. When a byte is received the buffer ring is incremented to ensuer the next byte is handled correctly.

Testing `bkbhit` will set to True when a byte has been received. Reading the function `bgetc` will return the last byte received.
