*Explanation:*

The `Loge` command will return the base-e logarithm, to 2 decimal places.

The values returned are fixed-point numbers, with two decimal places assumed on the right. or if you prefer, think of the values as being scaled up by 100.

*Example:*
----
    dim log_value as word
    log_value = loge ( 10 )
