Multiple I2C Adapters

'''''

*Using multiple I2C adapters*
 +
Connection mode 12 support up to four I2C adapters. These adapters can
directly address independently.
 +
The system variable *LCD_I2C_Address_Current* specifies the address of
the target adapters for all subsequent LCD write actions.
 +
To use multiple adapters you must specific the address of the adapters
and then set *LCD_I2C_Address_Current* to a specific address.
