=== Functions

*About Functions*

Functions are a special type of subroutine that can return a value. This
means that when the name of the function is used in the place of a
variable, Great Cow BASIC will call the function, get a value from it, and then
put the value into the line of code in the place of the variable.

Functions may also have parameters - these are treated in exactly the
same way as parameters for subroutines. The only exception is that
brackets are required around any parameters when calling a function.

*Using Functions*

This program uses a function called `AverageAD` to take two analog
readings, and then make a decision based on the average:
----
    'Select chip
    #chip 16F88, 20

    'Define ports
    #define LED PORTB.0
    #define Sensor AN0

    'Set port directions
    dir LED out
    dir PORTA.0 in

    'Main code
    Do
    Set PORTB.0 Off
    If AverageAD > 128 Then Set PORTB.0 On
    wait 10 ms
    Loop

    Function AverageAD
    'Get 2 readings, divide by 2, store in AverageAD
    'Note the cast, the result of ReadAD needs to be converted to
    'a word before adding, or the result may overflow.
    AverageAD = ([word]ReadAD(Sensor) + ReadAD(Sensor)) / 2
    end function
