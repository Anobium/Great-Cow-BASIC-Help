*Command Availability:*

*Only* available on Microchip PIC microcontrollers with the 16-bit PWM module.  16-bit PWM support includes both dynamic mode and fixed mode operations. See the examples below for usage.

For the Capture/Compare/PWM (CCP) module or the 10-bit PWM module, see the other sections of the Help.

*Explanation:*

This command sets up the hardware PWM module of the Microchip PIC microcontroller to generate
a PWM waveform of the given frequency and duty cycle. Once this command
is called, the PWM will be emitted until HPWM16Off method is called.

`_channel_` is 1, 2, 3.. 12. These corresponds to the 16-bit PWM channel respectively. +
The 16-bit PWM channel *MUST* be supported by the microcontroller.   Check the microcontroller specific datasheet for the available channel.

`_frequency_` sets the frequency of the PWM output. It is measured in KHz.
The maximum value allowed is 0xFFFF. The minimum value varies depending
on the clock speed. 1 KHz is the minimum on chips 16 MHz or under and 2
Khz is the lowest possible on 20 MHz chips. In situations that do not
require a specific PWM frequency, the PWM frequency should equal
approximately 1 five-hundredth the clock speed of the microcontroller (ie 40 Khz on
a 20 MHz chip, 16 KHz on an 8 MHz chip). This gives the best duty cycle
resolution possible.

`_duty cycle_` specifies the desired duty cycle of the PWM signal, and
ranges from 0 to 0xFFFF where 0xFFFF is 100% duty cycle.&#160;&#160;&#160; This should be a WORD value.
