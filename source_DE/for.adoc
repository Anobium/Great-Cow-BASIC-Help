==== For

*Syntax:*
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]

----
    For _counter_ = _start_ To _end_ [Step _increment_]
    ...
    _program code_
    ...
    <__condition__> Exit For
    ...
    Next
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

The For command is ideal for situations where a piece of code needs to
be run a set number of times, and where it is necessary to keep track of
how many times the code has run. When the For command is first executed,
`_counter_` is set to `_start_`. Then, each successive time the program
loops, `_increment_` is added to `_counter_`, until `_counter_` is equal to
`_end_`. Then, the program continues beyond the Next.

`_Step_` and `_increment_` are optionals. If Step is not specified, Great Cow BASIC
will increment `_counter_` by 1 each time the code is run.

The `Exit For` is optional and can be used to exit the loop upon a specific
condition.

*Example 1:*

----
    'This code will flash a green light 6 times.

    #chip 16F88, 8
    #config Osc = Int

    #define LED PORTB.0
    Dir LED Out

    For LoopCounter = 1 to 6
    	PulseOut Led, 1 s
    	Wait 1 s
    Next
----

*Example 2:*

----
'This code will flash alternate LEDS until the switch is pressed.

    #chip 16F88, 8
    #config Osc = Int

    #define LED1 PORTB.0
    Dir LED1 Out
    #define LED2 PORTB.2
    Dir LED2 Out

    #define SWITCH1 PORTA.0
    Dir SWITCH1 In
    main:
    PulseOut LED1, 1 s
    For LoopCounterOut = 1 to 250
    	PulseOut LED2, 4 Ms
    	if switch = On then Exit For
    Next
    Set LED2 OFF
    goto main
