==== Peripheral Pin Select for Microchip microcontrollers.

*Introduction:*

Peripheral Pin Select (PPS) enables the digital peripheral I/O pins to be changed to support mapping of external pins to different pins.

In older 8-bit Microchip devices, a peripheral was hard-wired to a specific pin (example: PWM1 output on pin RC5).

PPS allows you to choose from a number of output and input pins to connect to the digital peripheral.

This can be extremely useful for routing circuit boards.

There are cases where a change of I/O position can make a circuit board easier to route Sometimes mistakes are found too late to fix so having the option to change a pinout mapping in software rather than creating a new printed circuit board can be very helpful.

You *must* use both commands `UnLockPPS` and `LockPPS` to complete any PPS changes.
Great Cow BASIC includes these two macros to ensure this process is handled correctly.

Also, see http://microchip.wikidot.com/8bit:pps for more information.

*Example:*

----
    'Please check configuration before using on an alternative microcontroller.

    #chip 16f18855,32
    #option explicit
    #config RSTOSC_HFINT32

    'Set the PPS of the I2C and the RS232 ports.
    #startup InitPPS, 85
    Sub InitPPS
      LOCKPPS
        RC0PPS = 0x0010       'RC0->EUSART:TX;
        RXPPS  = 0x0011       'RC1->EUSART:RX;

        SSP1CLKPPS = 0x14     'RC3->MSSP1:SCL1;
        SSP1DATPPS = 0x13     'RC4->MSSP1:SDA1;
        RC3PPS = 0x15         'RC3->MSSP1:SCL1;
        RC4PPS = 0x14         'RC4->MSSP1:SDA1;
      UnLockPPS
    End Sub
