==== I2CSend

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
	I2CSend _data_
	I2CSend _data_, _ack_
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers except 12 bit instruction Microchip PIC microcontrollers (10F,
12F5xx, 16F5xx chips)

*Explanation:*

The I2CSend command will send _data_ through the I2C connection. If
`_ack_` is TRUE, or no value is given for `_ack_`, then `I2CSend` will wait
for an Ack from the receiver before continuing.
If in master mode, `I2CSend` will send the data immediately. If in slave
mode, `I2CSend` will wait for the master to request the data before
sending.

*Example 1:*
----
	' I2CSend - using the ChipIno board, see here for information.
	' This program send commands to a GCB Slave with three LEDs attached.

	#chip 16F886, 8
	#config MCLRE_ON

	'I2C settings
	#define I2C_MODE Master
	#define I2C_DATA PORTC.4
	#define I2C_CLOCK PORTC.3
	#define I2C_BIT_DELAY 20 us
	#define I2C_CLOCK_DELAY 30 us


	#define I2C_ADDRESS 0x60      ;address of the slave device
	;----- Variables

	dim reg as byte

	;----- Program

	do

	  for reg = 0 to 2            ;three LEDs to control
		I2CStart                  ;take control of the bus
		I2CSend I2C_ADDRESS       ;address the device
		if I2CSendState = ACK then
		  I2CSend reg               ;address the particular register
		  I2CSend ON                ;command to turn on LED
		end if
		I2CStop                   ;relinquish the bus
		wait  100 ms
	  next reg
	  wait 1 S                  ;pause to show results

	  for reg = 0 to 2            ;similarly, turn them off
		I2CStart                  ;take control of the bus
		I2CSend I2C_ADDRESS       ;address the device
		if I2CSendState = ACK then
		  I2CSend reg               ;address the particular register
		  I2CSend OFF               ;command to turn off LED
		end if
		I2CStop                   ;relinquish the bus
		wait  100 ms
	  next reg
	  wait 1 S                  ;pause to show results

	loop

*Example 2:*
----
	'This program will act as an I2C analog to digital converter
	'When data is requested from address 83, registers 0 through
	'3, it will return the value of AN0 through AN3.

	'Chip model
	#chip 16F88, 8

	'I2C settings
	#define I2C_MODE Slave
	#define I2C_CLOCK PORTB.0
	#define I2C_DATA PORTB.1

	#define I2C_DISABLE_INTERRUPTS ON

	'Main loop
	Do
		'Wait for start condition
		I2CStart

		'Get address
		I2CReceive Address
		If Address = 83 Then
			'If address was this device's address, respond
			I2CReceive Register

			OutValue = ReadAD(Register)
			I2CSend OutValue
		End If

		I2CStop

		Wait 5 ms
