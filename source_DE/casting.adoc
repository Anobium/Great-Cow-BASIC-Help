*About Miscellaneous things....*

It is possible to combine multiple instructions on a single line, by
separating them with a colon. For example, this code:
----
    Set PORTB.0 On
    Set PORTB.1 On
    Wait 1 sec
    Set PORTB.0 Off
    Set PORTB.0 Off
----
could also be written as:
----
    Set PORTB.0 On: Set PORTB.1 On
    Wait 1 sec
    Set PORTB.0 Off: Set PORTB.0 Off
----
In most cases, it will make no difference if commands share a line or
not. However, special care should be taken with If commands, as this
code:
----
    Set PORTB.0 Off
    Set PORTB.1 Off
    If Temp > 10 Then Set PORTB.0 On: Set PORTB.1 On
    Wait 1 s
----
Will be equivalent to this:
----
    Set PORTB.0 Off
    Set PORTB.1 Off
    If Temp > 10 Then
    Set PORTB.0 On
    Set PORTB.1 On
    End If
    Wait 1 s
----
Also, the commands used to start and end subroutines, data tables and
functions must be alone on a line. For example, this is WRONG:
----
    Sub Something: Set PORTB.0 Off: End Sub
