When using I2C LCD mode 12 the target I2C device address is setup as
shown below. Each bit of the the variable `i2c_lcd_byte` is defined to
address the correct LCD display port.
----
    i2c_lcd_e = i2c_lcd_byte.4
    i2c_lcd_rw = i2c_lcd_byte.5
    i2c_lcd_rs = i2c_lcd_byte.6
    i2c_lcd_bl = i2c_lcd_byte.7
    i2c_lcd_d4 = i2c_lcd_byte.0
    i2c_lcd_d5 = i2c_lcd_byte.1
    i2c_lcd_d6 = i2c_lcd_byte.2
    i2c_lcd_d7 = i2c_lcd_byte.3

If you have an I2C LCD display adapter with a different set of
connection of the adapter then change this configuration to suit the
specific of the adapter as follows. This should be done in the your main
program code.

    #define i2c_lcd_e i2c_lcd_byte.4
    #define i2c_lcd_rw i2c_lcd_byte.5
    #define i2c_lcd_rs i2c_lcd_byte.6
    #define i2c_lcd_bl i2c_lcd_byte.7
    #define i2c_lcd_d4 i2c_lcd_byte.3
    #define i2c_lcd_d5 i2c_lcd_byte.2
    #define i2c_lcd_d6 i2c_lcd_byte.1
    #define i2c_lcd_d7 i2c_lcd_byte.0
