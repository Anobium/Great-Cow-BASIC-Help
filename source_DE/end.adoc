==== End

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]

----
    End

*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

When the `End` command is used, the program will immediately stop running.
There are very few cases where this command is needed - generally, the
program should be an endless loop.

*Example:*

----
    'This program will turn on the red light, but not the green light
    Set RED On
    End
    Set GREEN On
