==== HI2CStart

*Syntax:*

----
    HI2CStart

*Command Availability:*

Only available for microcontrollers with the hardware I2C or TWI module.

*Explanation:*

If the HI2C routines are operating in Master mode, this command will
send a start condition. If routines are in Slave mode, it will pause the
program until a start condition is sent by the master. It should be
placed at the start of every I2C transmission.

*Note:*

This command is also available on microcontrollers with a second hardware I2C port.
