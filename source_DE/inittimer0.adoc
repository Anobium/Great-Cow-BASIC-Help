*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    InitTimer0 source, prescaler
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers with a Timer 0 module.

See also  see: <<_inittimer0_8bit_16bit,InitTimer0 8bit/16bit>> for support for microcontrollers with a 8 bit/16 bit Timer 0 module.

*Explanation:*

`InitTimer0` will set up timer 0.

Parameters are required as detailed in the table below:

[cols=2, options="header,autowidth"]

|===

|Parameter
|Description

|`_source_`
|The clock source for this specific timer. Can be either `Osc` or `Ext` where`Osc` is an internal oscillator and `Ext` is an external oscillator.
{empty} +
{empty} +
`Osc` - Selects the clock source in use, as set by the microcontroller specific configuration (fuses or #config).&#160;&#160;This could be an internal clock or an external clock source ( external clock sources are typically attached to the XTAL pins).

`Ext` - Selects the clock source attached to a specific exernal interrupt input port.&#160;&#160;This allows a different clock frequency than the main clock to be used, such as 32.768 kHz crystals commonly used for real time circuits.

|`_prescaler_`
|The value of the prescaler for this specific timer.  See the tables below for permitted values for Microchip PIC or the Atmel AVR microcontrollers.

|===

When the timer overflows from 255 to 0, a  `Timer0Overflow` interrupt will
be generated. This can be used in conjunction with `On Interrupt` to run a
section of code when the overflow occurs.

{empty} +
{empty} +
{empty} +

*Microchip PIC microcontrollers:*

On Microchip PIC microcontrollers where the `_prescaler_` rate select bits are in the range of 2 to 256  you should use one of the following constants.  If the `_prescaler_` rate select bits are in the range of 1 to 32768 then see the subsequent table.

|===

These correspond to a prescaler of between 1:2 and 1:256 of the oscillator
speed where the oscillator speed is (FOSC/4). The prescaler applies to
both the internal oscillator or the external clock.

*Atmel AVR microcontrollers:*

On Atmel AVR microcontrollers `_prescaler_` must be one of the following constants:

The prescaler will only apply when the timer is driven from the `Osc` the
internal oscillator - the prescaler has no effect when the external clock
source is specified.

*Example 1 for 8-bit timer 0:*

This code uses Timer 0 and On Interrupt to generate a Pulse Width Modulation
signal, that will allow the speed of a motor to be easily controlled.
