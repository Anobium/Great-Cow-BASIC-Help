*Syntax:*
----
    I2CStop

*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers except 12 bit instruction microcontrollers (10F,
12F5xx, 16F5xx chips)

*Explanation:*

When in Master mode, this command will send an I2C stop condition, and
re-enable interrupts if `I2CStart` disabled them. In Slave mode, it will
re- enable interrupts.

`I2CStop` should be called at the end of every I2C transmission.

*Example:*

Please see <<_i2csend,I2CSend>> and <<_i2creceive,I2CReceive>>
for an example.

Supported in <I2C.H>
