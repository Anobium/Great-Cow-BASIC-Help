*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers with a Timer 4 module.&#160;&#160;As shown above a Microchip microcontroller can potentially support two types of methods for initialisation.
{empty} +
{empty} +
The first method is:
{empty} +
----
    InitTimer4 prescaler, postscaler
----
This the most common method to initialise a Microchip microcontroller timer.&#160;&#160;With this method the timer has only one possible clock source, this mandated by the microcontrollers architecture, and that clock source is the System Clock/4 also known as FOSC/4.
{empty} +
{empty} +
{empty} +
The second method is much more flexible in term of the clock source.&#160;&#160;Microcontrollers that support this second method enable you to select different clock sources and to select more prescale values.&#160;&#160;The method is shown below:

    InitTimer4 clocksource, prescaler, postscaler

**How do you determine which method to use for your specific Microchip microcontroller ?**
{empty} +
{empty} +
The timer type for a Microchip microcontroller can be determined by checking for the existance of a T2CLKCON register, either in the Datasheet or in the Great Cow BASIC  "dat file" for the specific device.
{empty} +
{empty} +
If the Microchip microcontroller **DOES NOT** have a T4CLKCON register then timers 2/4/6/8 for that specific microcontroller chip use the first method, and are configured using:
{empty} +
----
    InitTimer4 (PreScale, PostScale)
----
If the microcontroller **DOES** have a T2CLKCON register then ALL timers 2/4/6/8 for that specific microcontroller chip use the second method, and are configured using:
----
    InitTimer4 (Source,PreScale,PostScale)
----
The possible Source, Prescale and Postscale constants for each type are shown in the tables below.&#160;&#160;These table are summary tables from the Microchip datasheets.
{empty} +
{empty} +

**Period of the Timers**

The Period of the timer is determined by the system clock speed, the prescale value and 8-bit value in the respective timer period register.&#160;&#160;The timer period for timer 4 is held in register PR4.&#160;&#160;
{empty} +

When the timer is enabled, by starting the timer, it will increment until the TMR4 register matches the value in the PR4 register.&#160;&#160;At this time the TMR4 register is cleared to 0 and the timer continues to increment until the next match, and so on.
{empty} +

The lower the value of the PR4 register, the shorter the timer period will be.&#160;&#160;The default value for the PR4 register at power up is 255.
{empty} +

The timer interrupt flag (TMR4IF) is set based upon the number of match conditions as determine by the postscaler.&#160;&#160;The postscaler does not actually change the timer period, it changes the time between interrupt conditions.
