    PS2SetKBLeds (_LedStatus_)
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

This routine will turn the status LEDs on a keyboard on or off.
`_LedStatus_` is a variable, of which the lower 3 bits correspond to the 3
LEDs. Bit 0 is for Scroll Lock, bit 1 controls Num Lock and bit 2
controls Caps Lock.

Note that this routine does not alter the status variables within the
INKEY routine - so even if the Caps Lock LED is turned on, Caps Lock
will stay off.

*Example:*
----
	'A spinning LED program for a keyboard
	'Will flash Num Lock, then Caps Lock, then Scroll Lock.

	'Hardware settings
	#chip 16F88, 8
