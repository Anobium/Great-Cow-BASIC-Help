Only available for microcontrollers with the hardware I2C or TWI module.

*Explanation:*

Should only be used when I2C routines are operating in Master mode, this
command will return the last state of the acknowledge response from a
specific I2C device on the I2C bus.

`HI2CSend` sets the state of variable `HI2CAckPollState`. +
`HI2CAckPollState` can only read - it cannot be set.

*Note:*

This command is also available on microcontrollers with a second hardware I2C port.
