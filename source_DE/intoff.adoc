==== IntOff

*Syntax:*
----
    IntOff
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on Microchip PIC and Atmel AVR microcontrollers with interrupt support. Will
be automatically removed on chips without interrupts.

*Explanation:*

`IntOff` is used to disable interrupts on the microcontroller. It should
be used at the start of code which is timing-sensitive, and which would
not function correctly if paused and restarted.

It is essential that `IntOn` is used to turn interrupts on again after the
timing-sensitive code has finished running. If not, no interrupts will
be handled.

It is recommended that IntOff be placed before all code that is timing
sensitive, in case interrupts are implemented later.

`IntOff` will be removed from the assembler if no interrupts are used.
