==== KS0108 Controllers

This section covers GLCD devices that use the KS0108 graphics controller.

The KS0108 is an LCD is driven by on-board 5V parallel interface chipset KS0108 and KS0107. They are extremely common and well documented


The Great Cow BASIC constants shown below control the configuration of the KS0108 controller. &#160;&#160;&#160;The only connectivity option is the 8-bit mode where 8 connections (for the data) are required between the microcontroller and the GLCD to control the data bus.

The SH1106 is a monochrome device.

To use the KS0108 driver simply include the following in your user code.  This will initialise the driver.

The Great Cow BASIC constants for the interface to the controller are shown in the table below.

[cols="2,4,4", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|*Constants*
|*Controls*
|*Options*

|`GLCD_TYPE`
|`GLCD_TYPE_KS0108`
|

|`GLCD_RS`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to Register Select on the
GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_RW`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to Read/Write on the GLCD.
The R/W pin can be disabled.
|*_Must be defined_* _(unless R/W is disabled) +
see_ `GLCD_NO_RW`

|`GLCD_CS1`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `CS1` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_CS2`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `CS2` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_ENABLE`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `Enable` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_DB0`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `DB0` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_DB1`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `DB1` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_DB2`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `DB2` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_DB3`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `DB3` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_DB4`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `DB4` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_DB5`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `DB5` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_DB6`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `DB6` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_DB7`
|Specifies the output pin that is connected to `DB7` on the GLCD.
|Required

|`GLCD_NO_RW`
|Disables read/write inspection of the device during read/write
operations
|Optional, but recommend NOT to set.
The R/W pin can be disabled by setting the `GLCD_NO_RW` constant. If this
is done, there is no need for the R/W to be connected to the chip, and
no need for the `LCD_RW` constant to be set. Ensure that the R/W line on
the LCD is connected to ground if not used.

|`GLCD_DATA_PORT`
|Not Available for this controller.
|Not applicable.

|The width parameter of the GLCD
|`128`
This constant cannot be changed

|`GLCD_HEIGHT`
|The height parameter of the GLCD
|`64`
This constant cannot be changed

|`GLCDDirection`
