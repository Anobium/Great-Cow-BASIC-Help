==== Tone

*Syntax:*
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
    Tone _Frequency, Duration_
----
*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

This command will produce the specified tone for the specified duration.
`_Frequency_` is measured in Hz, and `_Duration_` is in 10 ms units.

Please note that this command may not produce the exact frequency
specified. While it is accurate enough for error beeps and small pieces
of monophonic music, it should not be used for anything that requires a
highly precise frequency.

*Example:*
----
'Sample program to produce a constant A note (440 Hz)
'on PORTB bit 1.
#chip 16F877A, 20
#define SoundOut PORTB.1

Do
    Tone 440, 1000
Loop
