==== Select

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]

----
    Select Case _var_

    Case _value1_
      _code1_

    Case _value2_
      _code2_

    Case _value_3 To _value4_
      _code3_

    Case Else
      _code4_

    End Select
----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all microcontrollers.

*Explanation:*

The Select Case control structure is used to select and run a particular
section of code, based on the value of `_var_`. If `_var_` equals `_value1_`
then `_code1_` will be run. Once `_code1_` has run, the chip will jump to
the `End Select` command and continue running the program. If none of the
other conditions are true, then the code under the `Case Else` section
will be run.

`Case _var_ TO _var_` is a range of values. If the value is within the range the code section will be executed.


`Case Else` is optional, and the program will function correctly without
it.

If there is only one line of code after the `Case`, the code may look
neater if the line is placed after the `Case`. This is shown below in the
example, for cases 3, 4 and 5.

It is important to note that *only one section of code will be run* when
using `Select Case`.

There are two examples shown below.

*Example 1:*

    'Program to read a value from a potentiometer, and display a
    'different word based on the result

      #chip 16F877a, 4

      CLS
      Select Case Temp
        Case 0
          Print "None!"
        Case 1
          Print "One"
        Case 2
          Print "Two"
        Case 3: Print "Three"
        Case 4: Print "Four"
        Case 5: Print "Five"
        Case Else
          Print "A lot!"
      End Select
      Wait 250 ms
    Loop

*Example 2:*

This code demonstrates how to receive codes from a handheld remote
control unit. This has been tested and supports a Sony TV remote and
also a universal remote set to Sony TV mode.

The program gets both the device number and the key number, and also
translates the key number to English. The received results are displayed
on an LCD.

The circuit for the IR receiver and the chip is shown below.
